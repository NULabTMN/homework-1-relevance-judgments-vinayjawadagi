          April Fool.
          The origin or "April Fool" ia as remote
          aod as impossible to determine as the birth?
          day of the first fool who marred Nature's
          original design of intellectual Man. We
          trace it everywhere; but the Beeret hour of
          its birth ba files research. We are forced to
          admit its existence, without being able to
          assign a cause. The Romans undoubtedly
          enjoyed its questionable fun. They cer?
          tainly carried its memory in all their con?
          quests. Its observance was long cherished
          among numer?os nations. Abandoned to
          the yalgar in our self-elected age of extreme
          refinement, Momus seems to revenge him?
          self by selecting the most elevated and dig?
          nified objects for bis practical jokes. Nor
          man, cor nation, nor things visible, nor
          things invisible can elude bis satire. Nature
          herself seems convulsed with his sly sport.
          Her groans over a fallen race turn into in?
          voluntary, hysterical laughter at the bidding
          of this giant Harlequin, on whose kingdom
          tbe Ban never sets.
          The most pathetic scenes provoke the
          wildest mirth. We see men of bonor and
          repaie taking advantage of National schemes
          to secare private emolument; dividends the
          only consideration, the divisor of no conse?

          H E stage is in
          Eomo measure
          responsible for
          All Fool's day.
          So the histo.
          rians tell us.
          They say it
          grew out of an
          old Easter
          miracle play in
          Irhich the sending of Christ from An
          bas to Caiaphas and from Pilot to
          Herod was the basis of the mediaeval
          Jramatist's plot. But I don't think
          Hie stage has stuck to its offspring.
          We actors are a serious lot of people,
          particularly the comedians among us,
          for paradoxical as it may seem, acting
          Is all work and no play, and conse
          quently Jack is a dull boy. We would
          "MSTEIt, TXEASE GIVE ME A IIFT. JTLI.
          TOU?"
          T like to April fool our manager, perhaps,
          but we don't April fool ourse'ves, be
          cause that would be rather cruel.
          I have outgrown the frolicsomenes
          of April 1, of course; still I always look
          carefully after my coat tails on that
          day. And I greatly enjoy the motley
          of those who are careless about their
          parraental caudals during the Feast of
          All Fools. The sight makes me feel
          quite a boy again, for we youngsters
          used to do that sort of thing in Phila
          delphia thirty years ago. 0 yes, I did
          It, too. I believe that some of the live
          lier children of Philadelphia do it yet,
          and have vitality and energy enough
          left to laugh at the result, as a comio
          paragrapher would say.
          The most foolhardy of all the tricks
          which I can recall in connection with
          this carnival of jeering and nonsense
          Is one that I have never seen played
          Eince I was old enough to require two
          digits to express my age. A bag and
          two boys were the ingredients of the
          trick, and it never failed to 6core a
          great success on a quiet side street.
          One boy got into the bag and the other
          Stood by it waiting for the victim. The
          rest of the boys who were "in on the
          ground floor" were hiding in hallways
          and doors and behind trucks across
          the street. An innocent citizen came
          W sauntering along. The boy who had
          hold of the neck of the bag stopped
          him with a "Say, mister, please give
          toe a lift, will yer?" The innocent cit
          izen usually acquiesced and took hold
          of the bag to land it on the youngster's
          shoulder. Just as he got it fairly in
          his hands the boy in the bag suddenly
          kicked and screamed. Innocent vic
          tim, thinking it a bagful of wildcats
          or hypnas. let go quickly and ran off
          with palpitating heart and hair on end.
          while all the boys across the street
          pursued him with a villainous chorus
          of "April fool 1 April fool! Wash
          .your face and go to sclioU" or
          something to the same effect. It
          Talways seemed to me that the joke
          was really on the boy in the bag;
          he was sometimes dropped hastily
          and heavily and was hurtand occa
          sionally the April-fooled citizen gave
          him a thrashing besides for being too
          funny. But it was an effective trick.
          and often an old codger lingered in the
          shadow on the opposite pavement to
          witness and enjoy the sport. You have
          seen a man try to kick a plug hat full
          of pig iron over into tho next state
          Trell, bis discomfiture was no greater
          IT MADE AIM SMD.E.

          self when I was a toy. But ibey caa't fool me,

          than that of the man whoso blood was
          frozen in his heart by the unexpected
          scream emitted by the occupant of the
          bag. Laugh? It would make a tomb
          stone roll over in a fit of hysterics.

          fOMETIlIES IT GIVES PLEASURE TO OTHERS.
          It doesn't seem right that the firs
          flay of a month so full of pretty things
          j is April is should be inseparably con
          w nectcd in our minds with empty ard
          dilapidated pocketbooks with string
          in d-small-boy attachments, di&rep
          ntable hats with bricks underneath
          them, long streamers hanging from
          l nnsuspecting coattails, door bells
          rung by invisible hands, and all the
          other dear old pleasantries that we
          know by heart. And we should prob.
          ibly have had a society for the pre
          rention of Anril fool iokes Ions aso if
          It were not for the pleasure that call
          aren gel out of them.
          When a certain boy of my acquaint-
          fcnee on April Grst. before breakfast,
          Informs me that somebody is waiting
          ft;' see me in the library, not for the
          world would I refuse to go downstairs
          and pretend extreme surprise at find
          ing nobody there. Nor would any
          thing induce me to decline the suspicious-looking,
          cotton-filled piece of

          there is a little picture of mine in Puck,

          TO LESSEN THE DEVTL'S FOOLS.
          I am abked for a sentiment concern
          ing April Fool's day and pause in the
          whirl and rush of a righteous warfare
          to say that in my opinion time is far
          too valuable and important a factor
          for a moment to be lost in foolish jest
          ing or senseless joking. The world,
          especially in these days, is in far too
          critical and dangerous a position, so
          cially and religiously, to allow of a
          man with average sense to saj' noth
          ing of those who have consecrated
          brains to indulge in any other than
          profitable and upright intercourse.
          It is a personal relief to me to feel
          that in our ranks seventeen hundred
          officers and sixteen thousand unpaid
          local workers will be pushing with
          might and main of soul an enterprise
          which upholds sincerity and the ne
          cessity of lessening the devil's fools.
          Ballington Booth.
          A CHA3IPI0X FOR THE DAT.
          Before stating what jokes seem to
          me timely, and enjc&abJe ior this
          S&-
          " WIPE DE FLOOB WID niil."
          April Fool's day, I cannot resist th
          temptation to say that I think the
          spirit of the holiday itself hat always
          been singularly misunderstocd. The
          day is really to be deemed a pause in
          time's serious flight, when folly could
          with propriety travesty wisdom, and
          set the world smiling. As it is, the
          first of April has come to be deemed a
          nuisance, wheu its observance is not
          don away with entirely. April Fool's
          day is sadly in need of soue one to
          champion it and xestoi e it to its right
          ful place in the calendar. It is not
          simply the day on which the boys and
          girls may make fools of their elders
          with impunity. I suspect that there
          was a time when it was regarded
          rightly, far away as that time seems
          to us now. Then the old people put
          aside their serious looks and grew
          younger instead of older.
          If it takes a wise man to be a fool,
          surely April first is the feast day
          of the saircs. when thev can act on
          Shakcspsare's admonition: "Mingle a
          little folly with your wisdom."
          As for those jokes which seem to mi
          good and appropriate to the dav it
          should always be understood that the
          element of surprise is the essential
          thing. Novelty is wit. Jokes must not
          bo cruel pranks, otherwise the day
          would ba given up to a general hazing
          of everybody. The most successful of
          April Fool jokes would be to surprise
          one's friends by a change of character.
          What a rare joke it would be for the
          confirmed miser to bestow a dowry
          upon that niece of his who needs only
          a little money to marry the lad of her
          choice. If all the cranks would put
          rside their hobbies for a day, what fun
          it would be for the rest of us.
          This kind of joke can be carried out
          ad finitum and would never fail to bo
          successful. Let the tippler remain
          sober to-day just as a joke. The skin
          flint employer can have a lark with
          his clerk by granting that increase of
          salary that has been talked about so
          long. Let the clergyman I say it
          reverently preach a sermon only an
          hour long to-day instead of one of
          four hours' duration. I am convinced
          that the idea would meet with success.
          People too old for jokes on April
          Fool's day? Xouscnc. Even the gray
          heads can have their joke. The repro
          bate roue can go to church this morn
          ing and explain that it is all a joke on
          his part. Many a man is ashamed to do
          a good thing because it is so unusual
          with him that it would give him un
          pleasant prominence. But he can do
          it to-day and escape with the admis
          sion that it is his April fool joke. I
          am glad the day comes on Sunday this
          year. B. Gillax.

          APRIL CALLED
          OUT ALL ITS
          ARMY OF FOOLS
          The Jester and Victim
          Alike Make Merry.
          THE MORGUE'S BUSY DAY
          McENERNEY AND HIS COUN
          TERFEIT PRESENTMENT.
          Sad Tale of the Dentist Apprentice
          and the Soubrette Who Could
          Not Find the Key to the
          Curtain.
          April dawned bright and beaming and
          kept merry throughout its. first day
          blithely warbling between laughs, "Al!
          fools look alike to me."
          In spite of the fin de siecle pessimist
          and his prophecy that All Fool's day was
          a landmark of the past, the jester was
          out In splendid form and landed gudgeons
          galore.
          The fun began early and lasted late.
          A very few new jokes were perpetrated
          and all the old ones revived, while the
          usual good humor of both jester and vic
          tim prevailed during the entire day. The
          email boy was not so much in evidence
          ;is in previous years. Thoughts of Easter
          eggs on the morrow, coupled with the ar
          duous duties of trying on new suits and
          boots and hats, drove for once all
          thoughts of mischief from the mind of
          the budding lords of creation. The offi
          cials at the Morgue were the first to fall
          victims to the merriment- of the day.
          When the day was but a half hour old
          —at 12:30 a. m.— a telephone call, pre
          sumably coming from the Receiving Hos
          pital, summoned a Deputy Coroner to take
          charge of a body at the Hobson House.
          "Hurry-up wagon" and Deputy went
          quickly to the place, only to find that
          April had dawned and that some one un
          known wa? taking liberties with dignified
          city officials.
          In fact, the Morgue, or. rather, the
          Morgue's telephone, was the greatest fcuf
          : fen-r during the day. The bell rang un-
          | -ceasingly from early morning until mid
          i night and all sorts of messages were
          voiced- over the line. Heartless wretches
          also employes this method of fooling un
          suspecting friends.
          Tiner-aling-iing.
          "Hello! Well—"
          "Oh. la that you. Mary? This is Jim.
          Say Mr. Wilson wants to speak with you.
          Call him up— No. 1947."
          •'Hfllo. No. 1947! Ts this Mr. Wilson?"
          "No: this is the Morgue."
          A bang— that's Mary's . telephone— a
          enwe— that is the Morgue.
          While people were having fun at the
          expense of the city the' city was enjoying
          Its own pet little April fool joke—repeat
          ing the prank over and over a^aln and
          hailing each new victim with shouts of
          applause and the shrill tooting of horny.
          At the junction of Market. Kearny. and
          Third streets at regular intervals a box,
          neatly packed and stamped, as though
          rc-ady for mailing, would glare the guile
          less pedestrian straight in the face. Many
          a man, woman and child, representing all
          sorts and conditions of society, stooped
          to pick up the innocent-appearing box.
          None got any farther than the attempt.
          The shouts of the crowd, many of them
          previous victims, scared the parcel-picker
          off, and he hastily lost himself in the
          throng and waited in his turn for some
          one to laugh at.
          It was both a costly and hair-raising
          April fool experience that Walter Mosier
          had. Mosier. a young man possessed with
          an ambition to learn dentistry, is em
          ployed by Dr. Perkins, a Sixth-street den
          tist. Walter's bogs occasionally allows
          him to putter around the molars of his
          customers who are out of funds.
          One of thes? occasions arose Friday and
          Mosier was delegated to perform the
          charity service. The, victim was a boy
          about 12 years of age. He was suffering
          from an ulcerated tooth, and Mosier de
          cided that the nerve must be killed, so
          forthwith he filled the cavity in the
          troublesome tooth with enough arsenic
          to kill a horse and sent the unfortunate
          youth home happy.
          When Dr. Perkins came in Mosier, with
          the dignity of a full-fledged dentist, told
          his employer of his charity work. Then
          Dr. Perkins thought of April fool.
          "Say, Mosier." said the dentist, with a
          serious look on his features. "I've just
          received a telephone message to the ef
          fect that the arsenic came out of that
          boy's tooth and he swallowed it."
          "My God!" exclaimed, the would-be
          dentist. lf ls he going to die?"
          "Well, the doctors are working on him
          now, but they don't think they can save
          his life."
          "Say. Doc, I'm going to get out of town
          before this kid dies. I don't want to get
          pinched."
          "Well." said Dr. Perkins, with a merry
          little twinkle in his eye. "You can suit
          yourself about that, but I'd advise you to
          stay here. They-can't do any more than
          charge you with mupder."
          "Murder! Ugh! Don't say that. Dr.
          Perkins," retorted Mosier, tearfully. "I
          didn't mean to do It. I'll go and take
          some arsenic myself."
          The crestfallen apprentice spent several
          moments of contrition and then he made
          up his mind to get out of town. He got
          50 cents from Perkins and made haste to
          the nearest barber-shop, where he Invest
          ed it in a haircut and a Bhave. M osier
          gave the tonsorial artist orders to cut
          }-is hair to the scalp and Bhave his sprout
          ing mustache entirely off, hoping thereby
          m disguise himself. The badly frightened
          youth then returned to the office to learn
          further detnils of his mythical victim's
          condition. Dr. Simpson told him th« boy
          was worse and Mosfer. started to leave the
          office. "Wait a minute." called Perkins.
          "Where are you going?'
          "God knows where I'll go, but I'll never
          go to jail for poisoning- that kid," an
          swered the youth.
          "You go down to the ferry to-morrow
          and if the boy dies I'll telephone to you,"
          suggested the doctor.
          Mosier slipped out to his mother's
          home, borrowed 510 and as early as 1
          o'clock yesterday morning he arrived
          at the ferry thoroughly disguised to
          avoid possible detection. He walked up
          and down the cheerless and 'desolate
          wharves till morning, and then not hear
          ing anything from Dr. Perkins bought a
          ticket for Sacramento and stole aboard
          the boat like a skulking criminal. On
          the train he acted for all the world like
          a noted forger crossing the line to Can
          ada.
          ttosiec confided to a friend before he
          left that he would commit BUicide rather
          than go to jail, which knowledge tuning
          to Dr. Perkins made him decide noi to
          cfrty the Josh any further. A message
          was sent to the frightened youth, and
          he returned to the city. Last night he
          set about to drown his troubles in the
          flowing bowl.
          Garret McEnerney fell a victim to a
          deeply laid April Fool plot laid for him
          by his "close up" friend Jim O'Brien..
          The bulky and brainy man of the law
          dropped into O'Briens office, commonly
          termed the "Cabinet," yesterday noon to
          engage the contractor in a little chat.
          "Say. Garret." chipped in O'Brien in
          an innocent fashion just when the law
          yer was i-xplaining to Jim Nealon the
          way to make money, "when did you
          stand for that bust over in the Palace?"
          "What bust?" queried Mr. McEnerney.
          "Why. the file they put in the corridor
          of the Palace Hotel this morning," said
          O'Brien as seriously as if he was talking
          business with a moneyed man who want
          ed- to spend a "thou or two" in street
          work.
          "There must be some mistake?" said
          McEnerney. "No sculptor ever chiseled
          me."
          O'Brien is "close up," and his words
          had weight with the man who was so
          busy dissolving -the injunction against
          Chief Lees that he did not stop to think
          of April Fool's day.
          "Let's go over, Jim, and take a look at
          it," said MeEnernty, and .they both start
          ed out tho door. O'Brien had no inten
          tion of going over with his friend to seek
          What he knew to be a myth, so he con
          trived to' be excused In a manner ■ that
          would not breed suspicion.
          The opportunity presented itself when
          Judge Lawlor happened along.
          "I'm going to take the Judge on -for a
          minute," said O'Brien. "You go over and
          look at that yourself and I'll wait for
          you."
          Off went Mr. McEnerney and his April
          Fool went down on the arc.hives of the
          "Cabnit" as a decided success. Every.
          body who dropped into the Cabinet was
          sent over to the Palace Hotel to see what
          McEnernev had looked for in vain.
          "Pete" Dtinworth. the well-known vo
          calist, was- the victim of a ghastly April
          Fool josh. One of his friends telephoned
          to Dunworth's • house early yesterday
          morning and informed him that an inti
          mate friend had died the night before
          and was to be buried immediately.
          "They, want you to be a pallbearer,
          Pete," said th-e wily person at the other
          end of the line.
          "All right." said the popular tenor, af
          ter expressing genuine regret over tae
          unexpected death of his friend.
          Promptly at 1 o'clock Dunworth, ar
          rayed in a black cutaway suit and white
          gloves, arrived at the .undertaking par
          lors from which the supposed dead friend
          was to have been buried.
          "Is this where Mr. So and So Is to be
          buried from." asked Dunworth, giving
          the undertaker the friend's name and ad
          dress.
          "Why, he 1b not dead," said the under
          taker, "who knew the man very well. "I
          just ?aw him "at the corner of Sixth and
          Mission."
          At the Alcazar they revived the old the
          atrical joke of the "key of the curtain"
          with marked success. Mrs. Willie Dun
          phy, the latest addition to the company,
          ten minute* before curtain raising at thp
          matinee, was sent on a hunt for the "key
          to the curtain." "We can't open up."
          said Stage Manager Bryant. "We have
          lost the key to the curtain." Mrs. Dun
          phy. who glitters on the bills as Miss
          Howard, searched high and low for the
          key and was in a condition bordering on
          hVfiterics when the last bars of the or
          chestra died away and the curtain was
          lifted without a key.

        <text> Concerning the origin of the name and custom of All fool's day "The first of April
          lome do say. TVoa «et apart for All Fools' Day; But why the people call It «o. Nor I nor
          they therr.reUes do know." Thus an old English poet sings truly, for It would be a hard
          matter to find any one who can give an accurate and correct account of how the Ist of
          April came to be known as All Fools' day and of the ori gin of the custom pertaining to It
          of then _ trying to make fools W\ of people generally Sf , „ in every conceivable tjrfjf
          V^ WS&JS"'"^ manner. In old ¦ books of folklore al- most innumerable r I jo^w statements
          are made Bf &a concerning the or- B y - . igin of • both name it and custom, all dlf ' • "
          " ferlng as widely as the poles and bear " ; •. - ing not the slightest Wlatlon to each
          other. A learned antiquary, writing in 1599, claims that our April Fools' day Is but a
          continuation of the Qulrinalla, or feast of fools, bf the ancient Romans. In- "The British
          Apollo." a most ingenious work published !n 17C8. I find the following: ""Whence proceeds
          the custom of making April fools? Answer: From a memorable transaction happening between "
          the Romans and the Sabine.3, mentioned by Dionysius. Which was thus: The Romans, about the
          Infancy of their city, wanting wives, and finding they could not obtain the neighboring
          women by their peaceable addresses, resolved to make use of strata gem, and accordingly
          Romulus instituted certain games to be performed in the be ginning of April (according to
          the Roman calendar) in honor of Neptune. Upon no tice thereof the bordqring Inhabitants,
          with their whole families, flocked to Rome to see this mighty celebration, whereupon the
          Romans seized a number of the Sablna virgins and ravished them, which imposi tion, we
          suppose, may be the foundation of this foolish custom." This most absurd and wholly
          unjustifiable account of the origin of making April fools is thus ridi culed by a poet of
          the time: Ye witty tiparks who makes pretense To answer questions with good sense. How
          cornea.it that your monthly Phoebus . Is made a fool by Dionysius? For had the Sablnen, as
          they -came, D-partpd with their, vlrirln fame. The Romans had been Jtyled dull tools, "And
          they, poor Rlrls. been April Fools. Therefore. If this be" n't out of season, -¦•'¦;;
          Pray, think and give a better reason. Some old folk-writers claim that our April Fool
          customs are attributable to the fact that the year formerly began, as to come purposes and
          in some respects, on the 25th of March, which was supposed ?o be the day of Our Lord's
          incarnation. At that time' it was customary for all festivals to continue for an octave,
          or period of eight days. April 1 Is the octave of March 25, and the last day of a festival
          octavo was always marked by the greatest abandon and festivity. At the New Year season
          especially all sorts of wild, mirthful pranks were In dulged In, and of these It is
          believed that our April fool usages - were a part. Origins of a religious nature have been
          boldly claimed for April Fools' day by many writers. An old English antiquary, writing In
          1753. states that the custom of imposing upon and ridiculing people on the Ist of April
          may have an allusion to the mockery of the Savior of the world by the Jews. Something like
          that which we call making April fools Is practiced also abroad in Catholic countries on In
          nocents' day, on which occasion people run through all the rooms, making a pre tended
          search in and under the beds. In memory, I believe, of the search made by Herod for the
          discovery and the destruc tion of the child Jesus and of his having been imposed upon and
          deceived by the wise men, who, contrary to his orders and expectation, "returned to their
          own country another way." When the early Britons were Induced to forsake' their Druidical
          priests and Idols and to embrace Christianity, It was their custom" for many years after
          to annually hold in their churches at the commence ment of April a great festival, resem
          bling the Roman Saturnalia, at which they indulged in a thousand ridiculous and indecent
          ceremonies, gambols and dancing grotesquely to ludicrous anthems. These singular
          observances referred to the exploded pretensions of the Druids, whom this ' festival was
          designed to hold up to scorn and derision. That there Is no more effective weapon than
          ridicule was again proved In this case, for this feast of fools contributed more to the
          extermination of the heathen religion and its priests than all the collateral aids of fire
          and sword, though they were also freely employed. The continuance of customs— especially
          droll ones, which suit the gross taste of the masses— after the original cause of them has
          been removed. Is a very common occurence. and by many antiquaries It is firmly believed
          that "fooling" people on the Ist of April is simply a perpetuation of the annual public
          ridiculing of the old Druid's and their superstitions. Still another oripin. of a
          semi-religious character, 13 thus claimed for April Fools' day In a quaint old book of
          folk-lore called "Father Time's Flyghtes." pub lished in London In 1659. "numerous Jewish
          Origin of the Custom of Making Fools on the First of April. This is said to have begun
          from "ye mistake of Noah sending ye dove out before ye water had abated, on ye first day
          of ye month which among ye Hebrews answers to our first of April, and to perpetrate ye
          memory of this deliverance it was thought proper whoever forgot so remarkable a circum
          stance to punish them by sending them upon some fool's errand similar to- the Ineffectual
          message upon which ye bird was sent by ye patriarch." The French associate with the first
          of April precisely the same Ideas as do Enr llsh speaking nations, but the person Im posed
          upon, whom we call an April FcJ*. they style an April Fl3h or Polsson d' -v ril. In the
          "Etymology of French pro verbs," a most curious and delightful work published In 1356.
          Billlngton I the author, gives the following expiation of the origin of April Fool customs
          / "The word poisson is corrupted throtffn the Ignorance of the people from pasr'on. and
          length of time has almost totall- defaced the original intention, which w^ as fol lows:
          That as the Passion of c-n* Saviour took place about this time o'the year, and as the Jews
          sent Chris*; backward and forward to mock and't->rment him. 1. c., from Annns to
          Caiaph?*». from Caia phas to Pilate, from Pilate -°- Herod and from Herod back to Pilate,
          this ridiculous or rather Impious custorrAook Its rise from thence, by which we send about
          from one place to anoO«r such persona aa we think proper subjects of our ridi cule." But
          It Is not only thrjU&hout Great Brit ain, France and our/own country that fools are made
          on U« nrst day of April. The custom 1- elabrratfly observed throughout Sweden, aid In
          Germany an April fool la called elnen zam April shlcken." The same custom haa also been
          observed in India fr>m time immemorial. Late in March of <ach year the Hindoos
            hold a great celetratton which they call
            the Hull festival, of which the last day
            is the greatest aid most general holiday.
            During the con.nuance of the Hull, one
            of its chief dl^rsions is to send people
            on errands ar^ expeditions that are to
            end In disapr^ ntment an<l raise a lausi
            at the expend of the person sent.
            But the cistom of making April fools
            has-been traced back to an antiquity even
            greater t!** n that of the Hull festival of.

          LOST
          In Antiquity of
          Ages.
          April Fool Kept by All
          People.
          Gigantic Hoax Was a Complete
          Success.
          "This Is the first of April,
          Hunt the gowk another mile."
          From time itruneiuorlal thollrstof
          April has been celebrated by all sorts of
          hoaxes and playing of pranks. Tho
          truo origin of April' Fool Is burled lu
          tho dust of centuries and our great
          est antiquaries seem unable to throw
          any light on tho subject. Nearly all
          people however, celebrate this day or
          its equivalent and the similarity of
          the practice and tho coincidence of
          dutes establishes without n doubt In
          the minds of authorities ihe fact that
          It had an early nnd common origin
          among mankind.
          Nearly all tho peoples on the Conti
          nent celebrate April Fool with pranks
          and tricks, and even the Hindoos havo
          a festival on tho 31st of March, called
          Hull, which coincides vjlth our April
          Fool.
          Ono of the most popular amusements
          on April 1, or All Fools day, as it Is
          called, Is tho Rending of persons on
          fruitless frrands. Unsophisticated
          persons are sent to tho bookstores for
          a copy of the "History of Eve's Grand,
          mother," or to the chemist's shop for
          "pigeon's milk," while small boys arc
          sometimes sent to the harness shop for
          strap oil, when a liberal dose of this
          treatment Is usually administered to
          the boy.
          There Is a story told to the effect
          that Francis, Duko of I,oiTaIne, mid
          his wife owed their escape from cap
          tivity at NanteH to this popular cus
          tom. Arrayed as peasants, they were
          makiug their way out. of the territory
          when they were discovered by a wo
          man who knew them. She Immediate
          ly hastened to a guard, and told him"
          that the Duko was escaping. "April
          Fool," said the guard laughingly,
          treating the matter as a joke, and
          while he laughed the prisoners made
          good tlieir escape
          Occasionally a gigantic hoax Is per
          petrated on tho people as a whole, and
          such a one met 'with groat success in
          London in I8RO. Some wag distributed
          cards, bearing an official looking seal,
          which read: "Tower of London Ad
          mit the bearer to vlorv the annual core,
          raony of the washing of the white lions
          on Sunday, Aprij, 1, 1800. It Is par
          ticularly requested that no gratuities
          be given to wardens or their assistants.
          Admitted only nt tho white gate."
          This trick was highly successful,
          and people swarmed to tho tower to
          view tho washing of tho whlto lions.

          April-Fool Pranks Play Havoc With
          European "War Map.
          According io me map wmcu t-roi.
          U p Wrench has prepared and kept
          I . .. .- -.....- .
          In the corridor of the third floor of
          Academic Hall, European armies have
          made radical changes in their ma
          neuvers. The French apparently have
          given up the war and have fled to the
          western coast of France. The Eng
          lish have disappeared entirely. All
          the German forces of the western
          theater are quartered in Paris. In the
          east, the Austrian and German forces
          are massed in the lowlands of Prus
          sia, surrounded by Russian and Ser
          vian troops. A few Servians are left
          as garrisons along the frontier. One
          lone Austrian army corps has escaped
          and is now stationed in the middle of
          the North Sea.
          The havoc Is attributed to some
          April Fool prank.
          Another Instance of April Fool
          thoughtfulness was shown this morn
          ing when a member of the Agricul
          tural faculty phoned to the county
          jail asking "who had left a call for
          him."

          "What's that? The Fuzzy Fox in
          here?'" exclaimed the rabbit gen -Ionian,
          and ho gave such a Jump that

          ' "Oh!" exclaimed L'nclo WlggiB, BO
          suddenly that his pink nose almost
          ' stopped twinkling. "Oh. so this is the
          , first of April, is it?"
          "Yes, and I caught you first ofj
          all!" laughed Baby Bunty.
          And so she had, for she had come
          I over early to the hollow stump bun
          galow on purpose to do this.
          "Did I really make you think tho
          Fuzzy Fox was there, Fncle Wig
          glly?" asked Baby Bunty 'is the bun

          "You surely did for 3 moment." an
          swered the bunny with a lui.Kh. "I
          had no Idea this was April Fool Dsjy
          But no matter. My turn will come,"
          and he carried his glass of water to
          the sink, spilling it out.
          "Why did you do that"?" asked
          Baby Bunty In surprise.
          "Because," answered Uncle Wig
          gily, "I have known it to happen m
          times past that my glass of water on
          April Fool morning would be full of
          salt. As I don't want to drink salt
          water now I lust emntiod mv rlaiu

          "Oh there wasn't any salt in your
          glasi " suirl Nurse Jane
          "No, " added Baby Bunty. "I never
          thought of that trick. I wish I had
          But maybe Oh. Uncla Wlggily! Look
          out!" she suddenly crlrd. "Is that a
          pin in your chair?" 1
          Uncle Wlggily Jumped up as If a
          gun had gone off. Hfe looked In his
          chair but there was nothing there.
          "April Pool!" laughed Baby Bunly
          again.
          I'ncle Wlggily said nothing but he
          sat down rather harfl and ate his
          br. ik fast. And when linby Bunty said
          "Oh. look out the window and see
          who's coming!"
          Undo Wlggily nevor looked up
          from his morning paler. But some
          one was coming along the, path to the
          hollow stump bungaliw. They were
          Curly and Floppy Twlltytail. tho plg
          gle boys. Floppv had a llttlo bas
          ket. "Do you want to look In this and

          "Well. I can pretty nearly gu

          gentleman It's some sneezing pow
          der or a lot of dried leaves' You can't

          "Oh. really, we wouldn't do such
          thing!'1 grunted Ourl
          "I'll open the basket!" cried Baby
          Bunty. So she did, and inside was .1
          lovely piece of cake that Mrs. Twisty
          tall had sent to Uncle Wlgplly.
          "April Fool!" grunted tho piggie
          boys.
          "Well, this Is a proper kind of April 1
          T
          Fool Joke!" said the bunny as he ate
          the cako. which was very good. '''It
          seems I can't be sure of anything this
          morning." he told Nurse Jane when
          tho children had run out and the
          bunny was finishing his breakfast.
          "You must he very careful." said
          Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy
          "I will," promised Uncle Wlggily,
          and he was. But even at that a num
          ber of- April Fool Jokes were played
          on him nothing very serious though.
          Once Jackie Bow Wow barked:
          "Oil. is that 11 hlir hnil I n u..n
          coat, Incle Wlggily?'' The bunnv
          nearly twisted off his pink noso to
          look at his back, but there was no
          hole in his coat at all. Another time
          Kittle Kat offered Uncle Wlggily
          some candy, and when he chewed It,
          Why It was sour Instead of sweet!
          And Kittle mewed: '.pnl Fool."
          "Well. I think it's my turnto play
          an April Fool joko on some one,"'
          said the bunny gentleman after a
          while. "I wonder what I can do?
          T want to play a real Joke'
          He hopped along a llttlo farther
          and, all of a sudden, out from be
          hind a bush jumped he Bob Cat.
          "Oh. ho!" howled the Bob Cat.
          "Your ears look very good to me this
          morning!"
          "Do they"" asked I'ncle Wlggily.
          ' Well, do you know what dav this
          Is?"
          "It makes no matter of difference
          to me what day this is!" howled the
          Bob Cat ' I on!y want "
          "Dear me' Look! Look behind
          you! Is that a hunter man coming
          with his gun?" suddenly asked Uncle
          Wlggily, pretending to see something
          back of the Bob 'at.
          a hunter man with a gun! Oh,
          don't tell me that! Don't tell mo
          that!" howled the bad animal, and
          away he ran as fast as ho could.
          "I can't tell you that, for there
          Isn't a hunter there!" laughed tho
          bunny. "April Fool! April Fool!" And
          lo h id played a Joke on the Bob Cat
          just In time.
          "Ha! Ha!" laughed the bunnv. as
          ho hopped safely along. ' April Fool
          Jokes aren't so bad after all'" And
          If the pussy willow doesn't cry Jn the
          night and want to bo rocked to sleep
          in the cat's cradle, I'll tell vou next

          What Makes People Laugh?
          rr SHOULD be a laughing world
          for the next seven days. This
          is National Laughter Week, and
          April Fools’ Day is Friday.

          Naturally, what is funny to some
          people is not funny to others.
          April Fools’ Day provides great
          amusement for many in the lowest
          form of comedy, practical jokes.
          Others, especially those who will
          find messages to call Mr. Bear at
          a number which will turn out to be
          the Zoo, may not see the humor.
          Dr. Winfred S. Overholser, a
          psychiatrist himself, does not ap
          preciate April 1 where he works.
          As superintendent of St. Elizabeths
          Hospital, he is forced to add an
          extra telephone operator each April
          Fools’ Day to handle the calls that
          will come in for Mr. Nutt.
          He calls it: “The annual barrage
          from juveniles in adults’ clothing.”

          All Fools’ Day
          nWE MEtr ©ME ITfiSEirCOEfSc
          By JOHN DICKINSON SHERMAN
          ASTEK Day anil All
          Fools’ Day both fall
          on April 1 this year.
          This is hound to hap
          pen every now and
          then because of the
          fact that All Fools’
          Day always fulls on
          April 1, while Easter
          bobs around on the
          calendar anywhere be-
          ipl
          7
          tween March 22 and April 25.

          Thus Easter may fall more than a
          whole month later some years than
          other years. For example. It fell on
          April 25, the Infest possible date, In
          1880. It will fall on the same date In
          1943. It fell on April 24 In 1859 and
          on April 23 In 1905 and 1910.
          Easter and All Fools’ Day only oc
          casionally fall on the same date. They
          coincide In the century 1850-1050, but
          siv times—l 800. 1877, 1888. 1923, 1934,
          3945.

          It seems incongruous, at first
          thought, that Easter —the principal
          festival of the Christian church —and
          All Fools’ Day—u day of practical
          Jokes and horseplay—should full on
          the same day—and on Sunday ut that.
          On second thought, however, there
          is nothing Incongruous übout It, ex
          cepting the fact that All Fools’ Day
          should fall on Sunday—and that Is the
          fault of our fearful und wonderful
          culendar.
          IJoth Easter nnd All Fools’ Day had
          their origin, away back in the begin
          nings of the race, In delight ut the
          approach of spring. It may be easily
          understood that the winter was u
          hard season for many of the primeval
          peoples and that the Increasing
          warmth of the sun and the springing
          up of vegetable life meant literally
          a renewal of life. So the vernal
          equinox "elebrntion of primeval peo
          ples was largely expressed In actions
          of exuberant Joy.

          So there was originally little dif
          ference In the celebration of the two
          days. In fact, the modern celebration
          of All Fools’ Day Is probably a sur
          vival of the less serious features of
          Easter day.
          Anyway, All Fool’s Da. Is apparent
          ly Just ns old as Easter. The Scotch
          call the victim of an All Fools’ Day
          Joke a “gowk” or “cuckoo.” The
          French name for him Is “un polsson
          d’Avrll" —April fish. The Romans cel
          ebrated the Feast of Fools on Febru
          ary 17. The Hindus have their Hull
          festival on March 31.
          So It Is likely that the popular cele
          bration In tills country of “April Fool
          Day” Is the survival of some pagan
          festival of the ancient world largely
          devoted to horse play and the playing
          of jokes In sheet* exuberance of spirit
          because of the coming of spring.
          The pictures show three phases of
          the celebration of April 1, ll)*'3. One
          shows a crowd of worshipers going
          Into St. Thomas’ church on Fifth ave
          nue, New York city. Another shows
          a survival of prehistoric days—the
          egg-rolling on the White House lawn
          by children on Easter Monday. The
          third suggests the pranks of All Fools’
          I Day.

          IS THIS YOUR DAY
          by Chaplain Francis Fay
          "The first of April some do say
          Is set apart for All Fools Day.
          But why the people call it so
          •T Nor I, nor they themselves do know"
          (Poor Richard's Almanac)
          There has been a lot of progress
          since the days of Ben Franklin, but
          the reason 1 April is set aside for
          All Fools Day is still not definitely
          known. Most historians think that the
          origin . is connected withthe adoption
          of Gregorian Caldnd'ar'. Prior to 1564
          when the new calendar was adopted in
          France 1 April was' Mew Years Day. The
          French, even then a nation which app
          reciated a good time, celebrated for
          more than a week from March 21 to
          April 1. Some of them were so pleased
          with the celebration that they refused
          to recognize any necessity for change
          when the new calendar came into effect
          they continued to celebrate their ten
          day New Year.
          To show their scorn (and, possibly,
          envy) more conventional Frenchment re
          sorted to ridicule. They called the
          revellers - poissons du Avrll. Liter
          ally translated it means April fish;
          freely translated - April Foo.l.
          (Continued next column)
          By the time the original poissons
          had died off, Frenchmen were in the
          habit of ridiculing someone on April
          1, so they picked on one another. Such
          a delightful custom was bound to
          spread. By the 18th century it was
          common in the English-speaking countries•
          Since it occurred in the saddest
          part of Holy Week this year, April
          rools' Day was a fizzle. It did not
          go unmissed. Even this day with its
          folly has a religious lesson and conn
          otation.
          Biblically the worst thing a person
          can be is a fool. It was considered
          so terrible that Christ warned anyone
          who in earnest called someone a fool
          that he was in danger of Hell-fire.
          Paul indicated that one of the great
          hardships of the early Christians wa^B
          that they were considered fools. That
          hardship was a blessing, because they
          were fools for the sake of Christ.
          Psalm 14 identifies the fool as one who
          says in his heart, "There is no God."
          If thereis anyone on Adak who fails
          to pray daily to thank God for His
          plenitude of blessings; if there.is one
          who does not cherish God's law as the
          ideal of his life; if there is anyone
          who prefers sleep to the worship of
          God, he is saying in effect, "There is
          no God." As far as the Bible is con
          cerned, as far as any thinking is con
          cerned, as far as I am concerned tha-^*
          man is a fool.
          Belatedly, let us all wish him a
          happy feast day.

          By United Press
          WASHINGTON, March 2.—The
          force of the federal government to
          day was thrown into the search for
          the kidnaped baby of the Charles
          A. Lindbergh family.
          The department of justice offered
          it’s complete co-operation in the
          search.
          The coast guard of the New York
          and New Jersey divisions was in
          structed to offer it’s aid to the New
          Jersey police.

          pared a request to all commercial
          airpor tauthorities to watch incom
          ing and outgoing planes and for
          their pilots to report anything
          which might be of value.
          Assistant Treasury Secretary Sey
          mour Lowman, in charge of cus
          toms, announced customs agents at
          border points or elsewhere will give
          all possible aid.
          “I hope the guilty parties will be
          caught and when they dre caught
          that they are hanged,” said Low
          man.
          The kidnaping stirred official
          Washington.
          President Hoover read early ac
          counts of the affair and was deeply
          shocked. He asked to be kept in

          By United Press
          TRENTON, N. J., March 2.—After
          Governor A. Harjy Moore had an
          nounced a reward of SIO,OOO for the
          capture of the Lindbergh baby kid
          napers and the state senate had re
          solved to increase the amount to
          $25,000, the reward was canceled,
          out of consideration for Colonel
          Lindbergh.
          Moore telephoned the distraught
          father and told him of the proposed
          state action.
          Lindbergh expressed the fear the
          reward might endanger his child,
          whereupon the reward plans were
          canceled.

          is interested, unanimously was

          The baby supposedly was taken from the room down a ladder,
          placed against the house under that window on the north side.
          When the kidnapers came out they left the ladder near the win

          gress on bills empowering the fed
          eral government to act in kidnaping
          cases were made in both the sen
          ate and house today by speakers,
          who called attention to the Lind
          bergh baby abduction.
          Senator Barbour (Rep., N. J.) who
          succeeded the late Dwight W. Mor
          row, spoke from the senate floor
          while Representative Seger (Rep.,
          N. J.) made a similar plea from the
          floor of the house.
          The house postoffice committee
          acted promptly today on a measure
          aimed at kidnapers, reporting out
          thte bill of Representative Cochrane
          (Dem., Mo.) which fixes a penalty
          of twenty years in jail and $5,000
          fine for sending threatening, black
          mail or kidnaping letters through
          the mail.
          Senator Bingham (Rep., Conn.),
          a close friend of the Lindberghs,
          said the kidnaping “brings vividly
          to the minds of the American peo
          ple the need for some legislation to
          curb this growing crime.”
          Senator King (Dem.. Utah), a
          member of the senate judiciary
          committee, said the “horrible sit
          uation may call for legislation.
          “The Lindbergh case emphasizes
          the necessity for the government
          stepping in, without encouraching
          on state powers, to help stamp out
          the most cruel and vicious racket
          in the nation,” Senator Patterson
          said.

          2.—Charles Augustus Lind
          bergh Jr., blue-eyed and fair

          Colonel and Mrs. Lindbergh is

          som.
          Seized in his crib Tuesday night
          as he lay slumbering and ill of a
          cold, the baby was taken away by
          kidnapers, one of whom is believed
          to be a woman.
          With cold daring, the actual kid
          napers crept up a short sectional
          ladder into the second-floor nur-j
          sery some time between 7:30 and
          10 p. m., took the child down the
          ladder, and left behind the ransom j
          demand, a note dropped in the
          empty crib.
          Lindy Willing to ray
          Colonel Lindbergh is willing to
          pay the kidnapers the ransom they
          demand, it was stated authorita
          tively here today, “if they will make
          known the means and the occasion !
          lor so doing.”
          The note, demanding the $50,000
          for the child’s freedom, was report
          ed to have said in substance:
          “We will be back tomorrow
          (Wednesday) to talk business. Don’t
          talk to the police or the papers.’’ i
          Colonel Lindbergh, grim and re
          ticent, aided in searching for the
          kidnapers, and was represented as
          ready personally to enter direct ne
          gotiations for the child’s return.
          Sensation Is World-Wide
          Meantime, the kidnaping created
          a world-wide sensation.
          Literally thousands of police and
          state troopers were put oh alarm
          guard, watching highways, and
          state and national boundary lines.
          Over the teletype wires of the
          eastern .states and up along the
          Canadian border flashed word that i
          one of the nation’s most famous
          babies had been stolen.
          The kidnaper apparently had not
          realized the furore and resentment
          their deed would cause.
          Police everywhere went to work
          with a will to come up with the
          kidnapers, while the federal depart
          ments of justice, commerce and
          treasury in Washington offered to
          do all within their power to track
          down the criminals.
          President Hoover manifested his
          interest..
          Aviators from many parts of the
          country offered their services, and
          an air comrade was sent aloft this
          morning to see if from the skies
          he could see anything along the
          roadways of valuue to the search.
          The commerce department was
          ready also to help with pilots.
          Colonel Leads in Search
          Colonel Lindbergh, worn by the
          anxiety of his predicament, worked
          side by side with the state police.
          During the night he helped to trace |
          down tracks on his property in the |
          fastnesses of the Sourland moun
          tains.
          During the forenoon he went on
          a mysterious errand with Lieuten

          two men. One of these had approximately size 10 feet; the othei
          size 8.
          There was mud on the window sill and inside the nursery on the
          floor. There were no fingerprints on the window sill.

          ‘Dislike for Strangers’
          May Betray Abductors
          By United firess
          MEADVILLE. Pa.. March 2.—Strong resemblance of Charles
          Augustus Lindbergh Jr. to his father, and his “hearty dislike of
          strangers” may lead to early return of the child, his grand-aunt,
          Mrs. Hilda Morrow- Mellvaine, Meadville, sister of the late Dwight
          Morrow believes.
          •The baby looks so much like his father that no one could mis
          take his identity,” Mrs. Mellvaine said. -‘And he heartily dislikes
          strangers.
          "I know he will cry and fuss and be unmanageable with his
          kidnapers, possibly betraying them.
          “He is unusually bright, walking and talking in a way far be
          yond his twenty months. His aunt, Miss Elizabeth Morrow, takes
          him to her nursery school in Englewood, N J., frequently.
          “After his first shyness he was at ease in the kindergarten,
          playing w-ith older boys and girls. He even learned to count to five.
          “He can walk faster than many adults. He has some clever
          little tricks, too, such as talking on the telephone. If he ever gets
          into a room where there is a telephone he will persist in taking dow-n
          th receiver, perhaps giving the operator a clew to his presence.”
          in a fast car and came back a cou
          ple of hours later on foot through
          the woods.
          Rumor had it that they had vis
          ited Flagtown where a group of sus
          pected bootleggers were believed
          to be.
          Meantime. Mrs. Lindbergh, deep
          ly stirred, bore up with the cour
          age of a Spartan mother.
          The first word prostrated her, but
          it was not long before she was ex
          hibiting the same courage as her
          husband, and she helped authorities.
          Once she joined searchers for a
          short period.
          Many Clews Traced
          Her burden was all the greater
          for she had been nursing the child
          several days because of a cold. And
          the kidnapers, without even trying
          to catch up some quilts, dragged
          the baby off, clad only in its “sleep
          er.” Moreover, Mrs. Lindbergh is
          again an expectant mother.
          Many clews were run down, only
          to end disappointingly.
          Before dawn, a Philadelphia truck
          driver reported sighting beside the
          rcadway, not fan. from the Lind
          bergh home, a bundle which ap
          peared similar to a baby or a doll.
          Troopers hurried to the scene on
          fast motorcycles, but found that all
          the man had seen was a bundle of
          papers.
          More than a dozen motor cars
          were reported stolen in New Jersey
          yesterday, and these were checked
          in the hope of furnishing a clew.
          The only one which appeared
          hopeful was an abandoned car
          found near Hillside, N. J—a car
          stolen from a Brooklyn man. Its
          headlights were streaming, and it
          matched description of a blue Nash
          sedan in which two men at dark
          Tuesday inquired at Princeton for
          the way to the Lindbergh estate.
          Dog Fails to See Abductors
          Police thought the inquiries might
          have been the kidnapers or their
          advance men. But they were at a
          loss to reconcile this with evidence
          that the kidnapers were familiar
          with the field in which they op
          erated.
          A faithful dog, always alert, made
          no sound, as far as is known, dur
          ing the visit of the kidnaper to
          the nursery on the second floor.
          The man may have made friends
          earlier with the animal.
          The kidnaping visit was well
          timed. The baby had been put to
          bed and Mrs. Lindbergh had kissed
          him good-night at about 7:30.
          Later in the evening, the nurse
          maid, Betty Gow, was startled to
          find the crib empty, and the child
          nowhere to be found. She gave
          the alarm, and then the authorities
          were summoned.
          But by this time the kidnaper
          had a good start.
          The ladder the kidnaper used
          HOME
          TWO CENTS
          yielded little help. Evidently he
          had been gloved, and his feet either
          were stockinged or his shoes cov
          ered to blur the shoeprint.
          The ladder had cracked as he
          came down, and there is a chance
          he fell, injuring himself and the
          child.
          Had Woman Accomplice
          His tracks led out of the estate
          toward the main road, where a
          woman’s footprints appeared. This
          gave the clews that the kidnapers
          had a woman accomplice, who
          should watch over the baby until
          l such time as they could bargain for
          for their ransom.
          A chisel was found in the woods
          near the house, but there was noth
          ing to link that definitely with the
          : crime.
          Workmen who had helped to re
          build the natural rock house on the
          mountainside were checked over to
          ! see if they had knowledge of any
          i prowlers, but so far as police re
          | vealed there was nothing yielded,
          i All the present and past employes
          were said to have been exonerated.
          Beside the press and photograph
          ers, there came scores of autos with
          the curious, and these jammed the
          roads nearby for several miles.
          The milkman arrived at 10:30
          a. m., evidently unaware of the kid
          naping, and delivered four quarts
          of milk and two pints of cream,
          most of which was for the little
          baby.
          Mrs. Dwight W. Morrow, mother
          of Mrs. Lindbergh, arrived at the.
          Lindberg home early this morning
          to be with her daughter. She mo
          tored down from her home at En
          glewood and declined to comment
          on the kidnaping as she entered the
          big stone house.
          Fears Child Will Suffer
          “The poor child has had a cold
          and will suffer,” Mrs. Lindbergh said
          broken-hearted. “We have been
          doctoring him for several days.”
          Colonel Lindbergh, quiet but
          manifestly suffering from terrific
          strain, said he suspected no one, and
          observed:
          “They must have got through
          that window” pointing to a
          screened window which would not
          close because it was warped.
          Baby Lindbergh was tucked in his
          crib at 7:30 p. m. His mother kissed
          him good night, after trying vainly
          to fasten a loose, warped screen in
          the nursery on the second floor.
          About 10 p. m. the nursemaid
          entered to see that her charge
          was sleeping soundly. She found
          to her horror that his crib
          was empty. She though at first he
          might have fallen or crawled out.
          But a search of the room soon
          showed her that he had been stolen.
          She screamed to the Lindberghs.
          The police know only that the in
          truder had used a ladder, put up
          in sections, had scaled it into the
          nursery, and there left a note—a
          ransom demand for $50,000; then
          had scrambled .down the ladder,
          making his way to a point down
          “Featherbed Lane” toward the main
          highway.
          Joined by Woman
          On this path, according to foot
          prints, the kidnaper was joined by
          a woman accomplice.
          The spot where the kidnaping
          took place is remote, situated up a
          rocky roadway off a main thorough
          fare.
          Olie Whateley, chauffeur-butler,
          was convinced the kidnaping had
          been planned carefully. This con
          viction arose from the fact that a
          fox terrier, usually alert, was not
          heard to make any disturbance dur
          ing the evening, leading to the be
          lie that the intruder perhaps was
          someone the dog recognized.

          Pays $50,000 for
          Stolen Baby But
          Gets No Results
          (Continued from page one)
          allied newspapers, offered $50,000
          Monday for “exclusive information
          which will enable any of the three
          newspapers to restore the baby to its
          parents.
          Col. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, head
          of the New Jersey state police, an
          nounced "a noted character” was tak
          en into custody and was being ques
          tioned. In a statement, he said:
          “Early in the investigation, a noted
          character was reported to me as not
          having been seen since the kidnaping.
          An informant definitely connected
          him with the crime and this is one of
          the lines of .investigation referred to
          in earlier bulletins.”
          According to the News Monday.
          Condon, through the “Jafsie” ads,
          contacted a representative of the kid
          napers. This representative told him,
          Condon said, that if the $50,000 ran
          som were not paid by April 8, the
          price would be raised to $70,000. The
          kidnapers’ agent added:
          “Tell Lindbergh we can hold out
          just as long as he can.”
          Seven Notes Received
          It was learned from an authorita
          tive source Col. Lindbergh has re
          ceived at least seven notes from the
          kidnapers other than the original
          ransom note which was left in the
          nursery. The notes, the source said,
          were sent first to Col. Henry Breck
          enridge, counsel for Col. Lindbergh,
          in New York. They bore the same
          markings as the original.
          The second note, it was asserted,
          raised the ransom to $70,000 and the
          subsequent communications contain
          ed no other demands. It was stated
          later than the kidnapers specified
          the ransom would be raised to $70,000
          unless it was paid before April 8.
          The date on which the ransom was
          paid was not disclosed, but the treas
          ury notice to bankers asking notifica
          tion if any of the given serial num
          bers fell into their hands was dated
          April 6.
          The morning police bulletin Mon
          day said no further contacts with
          the kidnapers had been established
          and there was “no foundation” for
          the report that Col. Lindbergh had
          offered to replace the currency he
          paid with gold.
          The police were still looking for
          Harry Fleischer, purported member
          of the Detroit Purple gang, and Abe
          Wagner and the bulletin said that
          polios departments in other states
          were following their movements.

        <text> Toss $50,000 Over Cemetery Wall in Paymen t of Ransom By United Pre* r EV) / Y ORK,
          April 12.—When $50,000 was tossed over a cemetery wall to ransom Charles Augustus
          Lindbergh Jr., another bizarre chapter was added to the story of the kid naping of the
          world’s most famous baby. Dr. John F. Condon, the “Jafsie” of the want ad columns, played
          the leading role in the nocturnal climax to his three weeks’ negotiations with the
          kidnapers. He hurled the bundle of currency to three men who lurked behind the wall, while
          Colone! Lindbergh waited a block away. The transfer took place at St. ——— 1 Raymond’s
          cemetery in the extreme eastern section of the Bronx, on Saturday night, April 2. But lead
          ing up to this a plot rivaling a mys tery story thriller was enacted. On March 10, after
          the announce ment in the want-ad column said “money is ready. Jafsie,” Condon received a
          telephone call saying that his message had been seen and he would receive another call on
          Saturday night, two days later. On the appointed evening, a taxi cab driver arrived and
          gave Con don an envelope. The note therein was signed by the same complicated symbol which
          characterized the original ransom note left in the baby’s crib. It instructed Condon to a
          spot near by where the would find an other note under a rock. Under this stone, Condon
          found a message which directed him to go to 233d street and Jerome ave nue, signed with
          the same symbol. A1 Reich, the former pugilist and aid of Condon, drove to the desig nated
          address. The car was parked in the shadow of the Woodlawn cemetery wall. Condon paced the
          sidewalk. IN a few minutes he saw a man waving a handkerchief behind the picket fence of
          the cemetery. Condon approached the signaler. The two had spoken only a few words before a
          cemetery watchman approached. The stranger vaulted the fence and disappeared. Shortly
          afterward he appeared again. The two men retreated to Van Courtland park. Condon begged to
          be taken to the baby, but was told the child was on a boat, and that it would take six
          hours to reach it. The kidnaper agreed to send some object that positively would establish
          that he and his asso ciates held the baby. One day later a note came call ing for $50,000
          ransom, saying that eight hours after the money was paid. Colonel Lindbergh would be told
          where to find the baby. The terms finally were agreed upon by Colonel Lindbergh and
          Condon. j Then, several days after the time had expired for the baby’s return, Condon
          inserted this message in a New York newspaper: “What is wrong? Have you crossed me? Better
          directions, please.” The message continued to appear for several days. It was in t morn

          Being: Made to Open New Avenues Leading to Restoration of Lindy’s Stolen Baby. NORFOLK
          TRIO STILL AT WORK Police Fear Gang* Negotiating With Virginia Men Are “Chisellers”;
          Higher Ransom Demand Soon Expected. BY BATES RANEY United Press Staff Corresnondent
          HOPEWELL, N. J., April 12.—Desperate efforts to re establish contacts or open new avenues
          leading to restoration of the kidnaped Charles A. Lindbergh Jr. were made today, but
          vainly. The kidnapers, apparently frightened at the fact that the United States treasury
          was on the trail of the ransom they took from the baby’s father without restoring the
          child, manifestly were ‘‘lying low.” Colonel Lindbergh and his associates, aided still by
          Dr. J. F. Condon—the “Jafsie” of t?he kidnap advertisements in New York papers sought some
          way of getting to the kfdnapers again, but their efforts to mid-day were un availing. It
          still was insisted that the men with whom Condon dealt were the real kidnapers, and there
          was still a theory that one of the gang had double-crossed the others; or that the whole
          gang was regarding the $50,000 payment as an installment prior to making higher demands.
          The aged Condon, distressed at the tragic upshot of his work, was endeavoring to renew the
          broken threads, but in many quarters, there was doubt that this task would be easy. .
          Norfolk Men Hopeful While Norfolk, Va., reports still indicated that the trio of
          negotiators there were hopeful of a productive contact in the kidnaping, there was still
          no reason to believe that the party with whom they axe dealing is other than a
          “chiseller.” There have been a number of these, wanting payment in advance of "delivery”
          of the infant, and there is a strong suspicion that the Nor folk case simply is another of
          these instances. The Lindberghs are known to thoroughly believe that John H. Curtis and
          his associates are sincere, but the negotiators thus far have been unable to produce the
          child through their contact. The 70-year-oid Fordham univer sity lecturer, whose "Jafsie”
          mes sages in New York newspapers are credited with establishing contact with the
          kidnapers, retains the con fidence of Colonel Lindbergh, it was revealed today after two
          mysterious trips by Dr. Condon. Carries Two Suitcases Condon's secret errands were con
          sidered significant because on his first trip from his Bronx home h carried two suitcases.
          Either one of these, it was pointed out, would afford ample room for $50,000 in currency
          of S2O, $lO and $5 denom inations, the same as made up the ransom money. When Condon
          returned after be ing absent about an hour and a half he did not have the suitcases.
          Shortly after his return he depart ed on a second mission, as mysteri ous as the first. On
          the first trip. Condon t*>ed a chauffeur-driven car bearing a New Jersey license, the same
          as carried by a machine officially connected with the Lindbergh search. On the next trip
          he entered a small coupe, believed to belong :o A1 Reich, a former pugilist asso ciated w
          r ith Condon in his negotia tions. Refuses to Give Report Condon returned from his second
          trip Monday night with the two suitcases. He refused to give any report on his activities.
          Reich explained that Condon had "been in conference in New York,” but declined to say with
          whom. "Has Condon been in touch with the kidnapers since Colonel Lind bergh's statement
          last Saturday in timating he had been double crossed?” Reich was asked. “I don’t know,” he
          answered; “but I don’t think so.” State, county and police officials still maintained
          every possible way to speed return of the baby, the latest move being by the acting
          prosecutor of Hunterdon county. This official, Johnson V. Aller, an nounced that the
          Lindbergh case would not be presented to the grand jury which meets today. This was in
          denial of earlier reports that the case would be submitted. Hunt Woman With Money The
          first excitement caused by the posting by the treasury depart ment of the serial numbers
          on the ransom money occurred Monday night at Greenwich, Conn. A'wom an was reported to
          have proffered one of the S2O bills in a bake shop on West Putnam road. When the
          proprietor of the shop, after com paring the serial number of the bill with a list of the
          currency printed ! in a newspaper, remarked it was a part of the ransom money, the cus |
          tomer was said to have snatched I the bill and fled. Westchester county highways were
          patrolled for a large green se dan, in which the woman rode away, i Later some doubt was
          expressed if > the bill actually was one in the < Lindbergh ransom senes.

          HOPEWELL, N. J., May 13. New Jersey authorities, backed by the mighty police power of the
          federal government, to day apparently were on the direct trail of the kidnapers and
          murderers of the Lindbergh baby. Shortly after President Hoover had called on the
          government heads to make the murder of the baby “a live and never-to-be forgotten case,’*
          it dramatically was revealed that Colonel Lindbergh’s emissaries had been in actual
          contact with the men believed with out question to be the kidnapers. The revelation came
          through Dr. John F. Condon, the “Jafsie of the want ads,” who paid out $50,000 for Colonel
          Lindbergh to the kidnapers, and was double-crossed. Under examination by authorities, he
          disclosed that the men had sent as a “token” of identification for Colonel Charles A. Lind

          Norfolk negotiator, moreover are expected to furnish other information that would guide
          police to the killers, now the object of the most relentless and widespread hunt in the

          on a lapel on the collar. Through this number Lindbergh traced it to the store where the
          baby's clothes had been purchased. He felt then Condon was in contact with the kidnapers,
          and the $50,000 was paid out. When the baby was kidnaped, it wore three garments— a
          flannel belly hand, a flannel undershirt and the sleeping garment. The sleeping garment
          was missing from the body. Marshall’s revelations recalled one of the series of news paper
          advertisements through which Condon communicated with the kidnapers. It said. “The package
          had been received'' and that “the party" considered it “the real goods." Betty Go\\. who
          viewed the mutilated body and positive ly identified it as the Lindbergh baby, was
          positive because of the undershirt on the body when it was found. It had been too long for
          the baby and she had cut off the end and sewed a hem with blue thread, Marshall said.
          Discovery of the pitiful, mutilated corpse, with the skull crushed, at Mount Rose Hill
          Thursday afternoon, less than five miles from the Lindbergh home, horrified the nation.
          The child for which the world has been searching for two and a half months was murdered
          soon after the kidnap ing—perhaps on the night of the kidnaping itself. Mrs. Lindbergh was
          at home when they brought her the news. Her grief and shock were hidden from the world, al
          though she was said to be bearing up bravely within the closely-guarded Sourland hills
          home the Lindberghs had built. It had been planned as a safe retreat in which to rear
          their child and have their home life. The baby's body was taken to the morgue in Trenton
          for Hope mounted for the baby's return when Dr. John F. Condon. 72-year-old former school
          principal of the Bronx, contacted the reputed kidnapers through his “Jafsie" ads and from
          them ob tained a "token" which convinced Colonel Lindbergh he was deal ing with the real
          abductors. Negotiations were climaxed the night of April 2 when Lindy drove "Jafsie" to a
          cemetery rendezvous with the kidnap gang's agent. There 150.000 was traded for a note
          saying the child would be found on a boat named Sally" at the southerly end of Martha*

          institute, who exam ined the baby two weeks before the kidnaping, positively identified
          the body. It was 3:15 p. m. Thursday when a Negro truck driver and his helper found the
          skeleton in a clump of woods about four and a half miles south of the Lindbergh home near
          the tiny hamlet of Mt. Rosp. The baby had been killed, appar ently by a blow on the head,
          and the body secreted in the woods about seventy-five feet, from the road. An attempt had
          been made to con ceal it in a shallow depression, probably scraped in the underbrush, and
          it may have been covered up until the wind and rain of more than two months brought it to
          light to be casually discovered by the hor rified truckman. The body lay face down. The
          sleeping suit was missing. Two dirty and rain-soaked shirts lay on the shrivelled and
          decomposed form. The stomach band and diapers were gone. Remnants of the child's blond
          curly hair clung to the skull. The finder, William Allen, ran back to his truck, informed
          his companions ar\d the police were notified. In an incredibly short time, garments of the
          child were brought from the Lindbergh home and found to match perfectly. The
          Identification was completed more fully later. The child had Lindy. ‘ Jafsie and two

          searching he knew he had been double-crossed, and he made public the numbers of the bill*

          to avoid a large crowd, Dr. Mitchell said: “I examined the body for two hours in a

          to “make the kidnaping and murder of the Lindbergh baby a live and never-to-be-forgotten
          case.” The President, in a brief, terse state ment, ordered the federal government
          agencies never to relax “until those criminals are implacably brought to justice.” The
          President’s statement said: “I have directed the law enforcement agencies and the several

          message was flashed immediately to all the government’s law enforcement agencies, and
          sudden activity ran like magic through the depart ments concerned. Attorney-General

          NEW YORK. April 16 —Revelations concerning the futile flight
          to Marthas Vineyard two weeks ago by Col. Lindbergh and three com

          the kidnaped baby in custody of two "inno

          Women Were to Be Questioned.
          Irey, chief of the Internal Revenue Bu- j
          reau’s intelligence unit, was ready not only,
          to tender Uncle Sam's aid in recovering
          Charles Augustus, jr., but to question the i
          women as to their connection with the case. |
          Through it all Col. Lindbergh held to a de
          termination to play fair with the kidnapers
          if they kept faith with him under the solemn
          contract entered into by Jafsle in the melo
          dramatic surroundings of a graveyard.
          In accordance with this “code of honor”
          Lindbergh requested Irey and his two “aces.”

          aw'ay from the actual scene of the $50,000
          ransom transaction, but permitted Irey to
          join in the climactic quest for the baby and
          its “guiltless” guardians.
          Respects 8-Hour Start Demand.
          The kidnapers had demanded eight hours’ start after payment 1
          of the ransom, and Lindbergh, not suspecting a trick, allowed that I
          period to expire before he launched the hunt for the Nellie off Cutty- I

          Mrs. Lindbergh and Betty Gow. the
          nurse, were convinced after careful ex

          with the advice of others, decided to
          pin all his hopes on the pledges of
          those who had stolen his son.
          The baby’s garment was delivered on
          Friday, April 1. The ransom was paid
          the next night by Dr. Condon, who
          handed to a shadowy figure behind a
          cemetery wall a box containing the
          $50,000 in five, ten and twenty dollar
          bills. Most of the circumstances of that
          transaction already have become public.

          eerie rendezvous with the emissary of
          the kidnapers. Col. Lindbergh remain
          ing a short distance away in the car.
          Dr. Condon was accosted as he walked
          along the cemetary wall and he turned
          the box and its contents over to a man
          of Scandinavian or Teutonic accent,
          whom he recognized from previous
          meetings.

          nized, with a concerted cry of elation.
          All eyes were strained for a glimpse
          of the yacht called "Nellie."
          But the Nellie was not there.
          Nearby, however, could be seen a
          number of boats, scattered along the
          inlets and bays.
          Search in Vain.
          Lindbergh zoomed down again and
          again, until it seemed the undercarriage
          cf the plane would clip the rigging of
          the boats beneath, or touch the sun
          tinted waters of the sound. He was try
          ing to read the names on the sides of
          the craft that seemed to answer the |
          general description of the Nellie. I
          There were yachts with a wide variety i
          of girls' names, except that sought.
          Grimly. Lindbergh and his associates j
          continued the disheartening search.
          The plane circled the Island and ven- '
          tured to ether nearby shores of the !
          Marthas Vineyard area. It was hopi-d I
          the Nellie would see or hear the !
          plane and signal to It In some way. j
          Perhaps those on the yacht had mis
          understood directions of their own j
          group and were in the wrong location, j
          If this were the case it would be ad- j
          visable to cover a wide territory.
          With ever-increasing misgivings, the ]
          plane continued to circle over the j
          neighborhood. At ope time the plane
          was landed at the village of Cuttyhunk
          and the group went ashore and Inquired
          of the seafaring folk there whether they
          knew anything of the Nellie.
          No one had heard of such a boat In
          that vicinity.
          Lindbergh Recognized.
          Lunch was eaten in the village. It
          was during this visit to the town that
          Lindbergh was recognized by several of
          the residents. One of the villagers
          noticed the name "Breckinridge" on a
          wallet. It was in this way that word
          of the flight first leaked out. It was
          not until later that Dr. Condon s
          identity was disclosed, and the fourth
          man has been variously reported as
          having been John H. Curtis. Norfolk
          "intermediary": John Fogarty, private
          detective, and others.
          Lindbergh refused to give up hope.
          All day long he wheeled the plane over
          Cuttyhunk and Marthas Vineyard. Onlv |
          the darkening shadows of eventide in - |
          duced him to call the expedition off j
          for the day.
          Crushed with pent-up emotion, the
          searchers returned sorrowfully to New
          York that night.
          Lindbergh could not bring himself to
          believe he had been deliberately double
          crossed He argued there must have
          been some unintentional slip In the ar
          rangements.
          Second Flight Made.
          Tlie first thing Monday he and Col.
          Brecken ridge again flew back to Cutty
          hunk and renewed the quest. This trip,
          too ended in failure.
          Meanwhile Dr. Condon eagerlv had
          been awaiting word from his "contact
          man.” Tuesday passed, with no message
          of anv kind from those who had taken
          the $50,000.
          On Wednesday. April 6, Lindbergh
          was prevailed upon to take decisive ac
          tion He had Dr. Condon insert the ad
          vertisement asking "What Is wrong.
          Have you crossed me?” and he furnished
          the Treasury with a list of serial num
          bers of the ransom bills.
          So far the answer to Jafsie's ad has
          been complete, poignant silence.
          Directions to Yacht Given.
          Dr. Condon was handed an envelop
          containing explicit directions as to the
          baby's whereabouts. It was in the same
          handwriting as that of other letters
          which played a part in the negotiations
          and it matched the writing in the
          original ransom note.
          The letter instructed Lindbergh to fly
          to Cuttyhunk. a small island off the
          “elbow'' of Cape Cod and near Marthas
          Vineyard. In a certain location along
          the shore of Cuttyhunk. carefully de
          scribed so there could be no mistake, it
          was asserted a 30-foot yacht, with
          “Nellie’' painted on her bow, would be
          found.
          On the boat, the letter said, there
          were two women in whose care the baby
          had been placed. These women, it was
          stated, were innocent of any complicity
          in the kidnaping, and Lindbergh's word
          was asked that they come to no harm.
          Lindbergh fully intended to do every
          thing in his power to grant that plea.
          In the event that anything went
          wrong with the plans, however, Lind
          bergh wranted a Federal officer avail
          able. Several possibilities of a slip-up
          had been suggested to him. There was
          the possibility the yacht would be
          found, with the women aboard, but no
          baby there. In this event Lindbergh
          would have felt fully justified in hav
          ing the women subjected to a grueling
          interrogation.
          Conflicting Emotions.
          The wave of conflicting emotions that
          followed reading of the letter of in
          I struction can only be imagined by those
          j not present. Hope fought and con
          ' quered the specter of fear that lurked
          i in the thoughts of the little coterie
          j privileged to be in on events leading
          ! up to the tragic denouement,
          j Lindbergh and Condon returned to
          ' the latter's home and picked up Reich
          i and Breckinridge. Reich drove this
          1 group to a place in New York where
          • Irey w'as picked up.
          ! It was now nearing midnight. Reich
          i headed Lindbergh's car north and onto
          I the Boston Post road. Through the
          j night the powerful car sped—Reaving
          towns and hamlets of Northern New
          York behind them, crossing the State
          line into Connecticut and on up the
          coast.
          The car halted at a Connecticut port
          on Long Island Sound. Here all but
          Reich remained hidden until the first
          streak of a New England Sabbath dawn
          appeared over the water. Reich mean

          1 car.
          Then the quartet went to the water
          front and climbed into a big amphibian
          plane that had been flown there for the
          purpose. With Linbergh at the con
          trols, the plane rose over the Sound and
          followed an arllne course northward
          to Cuttyhunk.

          The sun was just coming up as the
          big ship, expertly navigated by an eager
          father, came within sight of Cuttyhunk.
          Lindbergh's ryes were glued to the
          looming shores of the Island that lay
          Just ahead and below. Other members
          of the tense group read and re-read the

          Ominous Silence
          Marks Lindbergh
          Kidnaping Search
          By the Associated Press.
          NORFOLK, Va , April 16.—An air of
          tenseness, augmented by tight-lipped
          silence of the three principals, attended
          the work of negotiators here tonight as
          another week end, usually productive of
          developments, came in their eflorts to
          recover the stolen baby of Col. and Mrs.
          Charles A Lindbergh.
          A silence more strictly adhered to
          than at any time during their eflorts to
          negotiate with persons they believe to
          be the kidnapers served only to add
          to expectancy that some move might
          be planned to bring an end to their
          iengthy eflorts.
          I am sorry, but there is nothing w'e
          can give out or say at this time," was
          the response made by Rear Admiral Guy
          H. Bui rage, retired, in a blanket refusal
          i to answer all questions presented to him
          today. His associates, John Hughes
          Curtis. Norfolk boat builder, and Very 1
          Rev. H Dobson-Peacock were equally
          non-commltal
          Our negotiations might be consid
          ered in status quo," Mr. Curtis said, in
          declining to discuss when another move
          might be expected,
          A veil of secrecy on movements or
          contemp.ated moves, was clamped down
          shortly after Admiral Burrage and Mr.
          Curtis returned this week from an ex
          tended absence. On their return they
          authorized the statement that they had

          ing “Insurance” has made its appear
          ance in Hollywood and has brought a
          statement of condemnation from Dis
          trict Attorney Buron Fitts of Los An
          geles County, who said the literature
          sent film celebrities “tended to inspire
          fear."
          Jack Moss. Beverly Hills promoter,
          who Fitts declared tried to sell the in
          surance to numerous motion picture
          figures, was questioned by the district
          attorney.
          Fitts told Moss he objected to the
          literature which the latter mailed with
          his offer to insure Alice Brady, screen
          actress, against financial loss in event
          she is required to pay a kidnaping ran
          som.
          The literature was a colorfully writ
          ten account of all recent kidnapings,
          including the Lindbergh, Urschel,
          O’Connel and Factor cases.

          BOSTON. October 24—Police offi
          cials of New York and New Jersey
          came to Boston today and questioned
          John Gorch, 37, in an effort to deter
          mine whether he had anything to do
          with the collection of $50,000 ransom
          money paid for the kidnaped Lindbergh
          baby.
          Lieut. James Finn, a member of the
          New York Police Department, who at
          one time served as bodyguard for Col.
          Charles A. Lindbergh and who has
          never relinquished the search for the
          baby's kidnapers, came to Boston, ac
          companied by Corpl. William F. Home,
          representative of Col. H. Norman
          Schwartzkopf of the New Jersey State
          police.
          Before going to the Charles Street
          Jail, where Gorch is confined, the offi
          cers conferred with Deputy Supt. James
          McDevitt at headquarters.
          So important is Gorch considered in
          the renewed Investigation of the pay
          ment of $50,000 at a time when the
          body of the slain Lindbergh baby was
          lying beside a roadway at Hbpewell,
          N. J„ that Dr. John F. Condon, known
          as “Jafsie” during the investigation of
          the kidnaping, was reported ready to
          come to Boston to view Gorch.
          During the transaction Dr. Condon
          knew the man with whom he was deal
          ing only as “John, the Pole.” Police
          point out that not only is Gorch’s first
          name John, but also he is Polish ex
          traction and at one time lived near
          HopeweU.
          Local officials of the Department of
          Justice announced today that a com
          parison at Washington of the serial
          numbers of five $100 bills and several
          smaller notes found on Gorch showed
          they were not a part of the Lindbergh
          ransom money. Federal agents con
          tinued, however, to study his story of
          his movements since the Lindbergh

          Baby Silent—Jon Plays
          on Lawn of Estate.
          Bj th» Associated Press.
          NORTH HAVEN, Me., September 21.
          •-New* of the arrest of Bruno Rich
          ard Hauptmann, New York carpenter,
          In the Lindbergh kidnap case yester
          day interrupted Indian Summer tran
          quillity at the estate of Mrs. Dwight
          W. Morrow.
          As soon as word of the sensatioual
          development reached Mrs. Morrow,
          grandmother of the Lindbergh baby,
          she denied herself to newspaper men.
          Inquirers at the Morrow Summer home
          were referred to Col. Henry Brecken
          ridge. Col. Lindbergh's attorney, In
          New York.
          The news came as the Morrow fam
          ily was gathered for a brief reunion
          before the children returned to their
          studies. With the mother here were
          Dwight W. Morrow, Jr., and Constance
          Morrow, who herself was the object
          of a kidnaping threat when a student
          at Milton Academy, Milton, Mass.
          Jon Romps on Lawn.
          The Lindbergh's second son.%-year
          old Jon, romped on the lawn in the
          care of his nurse, Shirley Grant, 20
          year-old North Haven girl.
          As news of the arrest circulated
          among townsfolk they were quick to
          express hope the case might be brought
          to speedy conclusion and erased from
          the family’s bitter memories of the
          tragedy.
          Well acquainted with the Lindberghs
          and the Morrows as a result of their
          annual visit to the picturesque resort,
          residents of North Haven respect the
          desire of the family for privacy and1
          seclusion.
          Those who have seen Jon Lindbergh
          with his nurse about the village often
          remark upon the close likeness between
          him and the kidnaped first son.
          They refer with some pride to the
          fact that Miss Grant, one of their
          own townspeople and daughter of the
          caretaker of the Morrow estate, has
          been entrusted with the responsibility
          for caring for the famous baby. It
          was generally understood In the com
          munity Miss Grant had been offered
          the opportunity to remain In perma
          nent charge of the child as a successor
          to Betty Oow.
          Miss Oow was the Scottish nurse
          who discovered the kidnaping of
          Charles A. Lindbergh. jr„ from the
          Lindbergh home in Hopewell, J.,
          more than two years ago. She re
          turned to her Scotland home in the
          early Summer.

          NEW YORK. September 21.—Prom
          a maze of numbers there came two
          sets of figures which led to the arrest
          of the man held as the receiver of the
          Lindbergh ransom money.
          One set was the serial number on
          a $10 gold note, received at a gasoline
          filling station and Identified as one
          or the several thousands ot bills which
          made up the package of $50,000 which
          Col. Charles A. Lindbergh paid for the
          return of his son.
          Without another set of figures, how*
          ever, that bill would have been Just
          another of many that had turned up
          since the night two and a half yean
          ago that the money was paid.
          Those figures were: 4U-1341—the
          license number of the automobUe
          whose driver paid out the $10 bUl lor
          gasoline.
          Separately the numbers meant ltttle
          or nothing. Together they formed a
          combination that has led to the most
          Important development In the solu
          tion of the kidnaping mystery since
          its inception.

          New York, Sept. 26.—(AP) —Bruno
          Richard Hauptmann, unemployed
          German carpenter illegally in this
          country, was indicted by a Bronx
          county grand jury Wednesday on a
          charge of extortion as the receiver of
          the $50,000 Col. Charles A. Lindbergh
          paid two and a half years ago in an
          ineffectual effort to ransom his kid
          naped son.
          The indictment was returned with
          in three hours after Col. Lindbergh
          had appeared before the grand jury
          and told them his own story of the
          ransom negotiations conducted
          through Dr. John F. Condon. Bronx
          educator and the “Jafsie” of the ran
          som efforts. The true bill contained
          but one count, alleging extortion of
          the $50,000 ransom payment.
          At District Attorney Foley’s office
          it was said Hauptmann probably
          would be arraigned Thursday on a
          bench warrant issued when the in
          dictment was handed up.
          The maximum sentence upon con
          viction for extortion is 20 years’ im
          prisonment.
          Lists 24 Allegations
          In summing up evidence against
          Hauptmann, District Attorney Foley
          was asked for an Indictment on the
          following grounds:
          1. The kidnaper’s ransom notes in
          dicate their author was a German, as
          is Hauptmann.
          2. The ladder used to reach the
          baby’a nursery was made by a man
          accustomed to fashioning wood joints
          expertly. Hauptmann is a carpenter.
          3. The lumber used to make the
          ladder was traced to the National
          Mill Work As Lumber Co., in the
          Bronx. Hauptmann worked there,
          bought lumber there for neighbor
          hood jobs.
          4. The nails used in thz ladder are
          said to have the same grooving aa
          nails of the same aiae found In
          Hauptmann’s home.
          5. The print of a shoeless er wrap
          ped foot ouside the Lindbergh home
          is similar to Hauptmann’s footprint.

        <text> Condon Tells Story of Ransom' Negotiations and His Effort to Induce "John" to Return
          Baby (Continued From First Page.) Interrupted time after time by the prosecution and
          defense. "I object to what he said at that time," Fisher would thunder. "Now, just don't
          tell us what you said. but only what you did," Wilentz gently cautioned. Condon is almost
          old enough to be Wilentz's grandfather. Condon taught "boys" of WilenU's present age about
          the time the attor ney general was born. The prosecutor handled the vener able witness
          with the patience he might employ with a child. Condon was a difficult student. Wi lentz
          was a tireless, kindly teacher. Condon would grin sheepishly after every technical error
          in his testimony. Condon at length told how he and Retch finally got to Woodlawn Ceme
          tery. "I got out of the car and went over to the space in front of the gates. I took out
          the letter and read it again." "What happened?" Returned A^ain to Car. "Nothing fer a
          while," said the doc tor, noting that a man walked down the street in the meanwhile. He
          went back to the car for a few minutes. Then the kidnaper signaled him. he said. "1 saw a
          handkerchief being waved." Condon described the first time he met the ransom collector.
          "Who is the man who spoke to you between the gates of the cemetery?" Wilentz asked.
          "John." "And who is John?" "Bruno Richard Hauptmann." Condon said: "The man was inside the
          ccmetery gate." Q. And then what happened? A. Well, he kept waving the hand kerchief
          through the bars of the gate. Q. Then? A. Then I went and said, "I know you." Alarmed bv a
          rustle in the ceme tery. John quickly scaled the cemetery fence, "turner fashion," Condon
          re lated. John ran, saying "cops" were there, he added. * Called "John" Cowardly. As
          "John" fled into Van Cortlandt Park, Jafsie dramatically continued: "I .aid. 'Hey. come
          back here. Don't be cowardly. Here I am a poor school teacher and you're leaving me here
          to be drilled.' " Jafsie related how he caught up with John and sat down with him on a
          park bench. Condon described the cemetery scene dramatically. "He told me. 'It's too
          dangerous. It's 20 yea.'t or burn." "Then he asked me. Would I burn if the baby were
          dead?' "I told him not if he hadn't killed the baby and if he would tell all about it."
          Condon said he himself took the safety pins from the baby is bed "with, as you might say,
          'French leave.' " He said he had them when he met "John" in the cemetery. " 'I'm only the
          go-between,' he told me." Condon said. Condon recounted how he promised to help John all
          possible if he co operated, " 'but if you fail me, I'll follow you to Australia.' " Baby's
          Return Promised. " 'We won't. You will get that baby and put it in its mother's arms.' "
          Condon told how he besought John to quit me gang he said he repre sented. but John said
          the "leader" would "smack him down." " 'Are you a German!' " Condon said \ he asked him
          and "John" replied, , " No, a Scandinavian.'" John also told him that night the abduction
          had been "prepared a year already," but was adamant when j Jafsie pleaded to be taken to
          the I baby." the witness continued. "You have nothing to be afraid of. I've been square
          all my life and I'm square now. "I'll go as a hostage to the man j who has the baby. I
          have three toys belonging to the baby. "I couldn't see the child," Condon continued to
          relate. "He said they'd 'drill' him. "I said. 'Don't be afraid. Do what you think is
          right. Do it for your mother's sake.' " Asked to See Baby. Condon said he urged the ransom
          collector to take him to the baby. "That was all I wanted," he declared, "to take that
          baby back to its mother's arms." "He said they'd flash a light from a ι boat," Condon went
          on. "And I said i Col. Lindbergh would go anywhere in : a plane to recover his little
          child." Condon continued, "he said he'd send me the baby's sleeping suit." "Is this it?"
          Wilentz handed him an exhibit. "That is the baby's sleeping suit I received, Condon said.
          Condon said the cemetery conversa tion lasted an hour and 10 or 15 minutes. The fantastic
          conference that cold night in Van Cortlandt Park eventual ly broke up. after John promised
          to send him the sleeping suit. Court recessed for 10 minutes at 11:39, E. S. T., with the
          Bronx edu cator still on direct examination. Condon left court during the recess, but he
          was back on the stand, genial and smiling, when the session re sumed. The spectator jam
          seemed to have increased during the recess. Some were I even standing on the edges of
          Juitice Trenchard'a bench. Jury Listen· Intently. Condon's testimony had drawn the
          attention of the jury. The four women in the bo* bent forward as the old man recited hi·
          adventures with "John" and the ransom. When the Jury returned to the box the members
          regarded the teacjriei curiously. Then they looked at Haupt mann, who leaned back in his
          chair. The former German machine gunner seemed undaunted. Condon carefully adjusted his
          tie. brushed imaginary dust from his sleeves, adjusted his coat and faced the Jury as he
          resumed his story. The next chapter was how the sleep ing suit arrived at his Bronx home ι
          in accordance with "John's" promise. "I opened it in my parlor. Q. Who was present? A.
          Col. Lindbergh and Col. Breck inridge. The letter which Condon identified as coming with
          the garment was read to the jury by Wilentz. It gave fresh instructions for the
          negotiations, di recting an advertisement be published in a New York paper: "I accept.
          Money is ready." Hauptmann Watches Jafsie. Hauptmann's arms were folded across his chest.
          He stared, red of face and lean of jaw. at Condon. He paid no attention to Wilentz as the
          attorney general read and spelled his way through the grammatically and orthographically
          incorrect ransom note. He told how he placed the ad be ginning "I accept. Money Is ready."
          in a New York paper, after conferring with Col. Breckinridge. "Following that did you
          receive an other letter or note?" "Yes. I did." Wilentz established the dates of the
          receipt of the note. "I brought Col. Lindbergh into the living room, then I spread the
          sleep ing suit on the piano, and he saw It." Condon said, extending a hand as though
          offering the garment to the flying colonel. "I asked Col. Lindbergh if I was doing right,
          and he said it was all right. "Then I went ahead and did what the notes said for me to
          do." As the note was being offered in evidence Jafsie stared hard at Haupt mann from under
          his shaggy brows. Wilentz again carefully read this note to the attentive Jury, stressing
          the bad spelling. The note follows: "Dear sir: You and Mr. Lindbergh know ouer program. If
          you don't ac cept den we will wait untlll you agree with ouer deal. We know you have to
          come to us anyway But why should Mis. and Mr. Lindbergh suffer longer as necessary. We

          already so the police won't have any looks to And us or the child. You only puch everyding
          further out did you send that little package to Mr. Lindbergh it contains the sleeping
          suit from the baby. The baby Is well." Jafsie put on his glasses to scruti nize the note.
          He peered at It long, his head moving as he scanned line after line. He rubbed his chin
          frequently. It was minutes before he looked up. Then he said. "Yes, sir, that is the
          letter I received at my home." Turning from the jury, Wilenti asked Condon if he had
          Inserted an other ad In the papers as the result of this latest note from John. "I did."
          said the doctor, with a nod of his head. Reilly, always ruddy of face, was a beet-like
          crimson. He sat at the defense counsel table, his lower lip drawn over the upper. Counsel
          Shows Impatience. At times he bowed to »me\l the white carnation in his lapel. He shifted
          his glance from his knees to the floor, to Wllentz and infrequently to Condon. He was
          biding his time—but not with any show of patience. Other members of the defense staff
          watched the proceeding* soberly. Col. Lindbergh, one knee thrown over the other, his hands
          folded over the uppermost knee, watched the drama before him with keen interest. He has
          always been attentive at the trial. Today he was particu larly so. The advertisement was
          not read In court, and the trim attorney general offered Jafsie a ransom letter post
          marked March 29, 1932. Jafsie said the communication ar rived at his Bronx home. He
          perused It with exacting carefulness. " That is the letter I received," he said
          emphatically. Wilents took the letter and walked over to the Jury. Once more the Jurors
          heard another of the strange epistles John sent Jefsle. Wilenti read slowly. It was: "Dear
          sir: It is not* necessary to furnish any code. You and Mr. Lind bergh know ouer program
          very well we will keep the child In our save plase until we have the money in hand but if

Wilents gave Condon still another
note—a ransom note enclosed in the
usual transparent envelope used by
:he State to preserve these documents.
Sara He Received Letter.
"Yes. air; I received that letter," he
replied after inspecting it carefully.
The note was admitted in evidence
and once again Wilentz read to the

It said:

The retired teacher then identified

"I accept. Money is ready," said
the ad which appeared April 2.
It Was on that day the ransom
money was brought to Condon s Bronx

It was on this day. too, he went on.
that a note from John waa delivered
at his home.
The Jurora seemed even more tense
is they leaned forward to hear
Wilentz read this note, the next to last

The note said:

Condon identified the note as " the

          entered the court near the end of the noon recess. Hauptmann. with a wan smile on his
          ashen face, talked quietly with his counsel in the minutes before court convened. He
          seemed to be a little tired. Court resumed at 1:46 pm. fJafsie took the sland again.
          Wilentz picked up the questioning rrcm «here he left off—the trip of Jafsie and Lindbergh
          to St. Raymond's Cemetery to pay the $50,000 ransom. There followed a long descriptive
          narrative of the geography of St Raymonds Cemetery. Lindbergh followed closelv the doc- '
          tor's description of the route he took after he had left him to pay the ransom. The flyer
          nodded in apparent un- , conscious agreement at times "I showed him »Col. Lindbergh) the
          note," related Jafsie, describing his actions after getting the note at the greenhouse.
          Followed Note Directions. I then walked across the street following the directions of the
          note ,"-Lthen wallced "long the east side! or Tremont avenue past the entrance of the gate
          of the cemetery." He said he saw no one and was re tracing his steps to report to the
          colonel when he heard himself hailed In a loud voice. Then, °' a sudden, I heard be hind
          me a voice calling: " Hey, doctor. Over here!"· Con don said. Dr. Condon lengthened the
          "o" and rolled the "r" in "doctor" to give It a slight foreign accent. 'Then I walked back
          toward the voice, which seemed to come from a mound in St. Raymond's cemetery "It was very
          dark. But I stood In the light of the street lamp " he continued. ' "There was a hedge
          fence about 5 ! feet tall." he said, describing the spot whence came the voice. Q. Is that
          a continuation of the cemetery? A. Yes. sir. Q. How far did you go? Heard Voice Again. A.
          I went about 10 feet, and there again I heard the same -voice as I heard when I was up on
          the corner when he called "Hey, doktor." Q. Then what? A. He said, "Have you got the
          money?" the same, as he said the n'Kht I met him at Woodlawn Ceme- i tery. I said. 'Col.
          Lindbergh has It ' " Condon continued. "He said, 'Is he on?' "I said, Ί don't know.' *'He
          said, 'Give me the money.· "I said, 'not 'till you give me a re ceipt—beg pardon—a note,
          saying we'll get the baby." Sanson» Reduction Asked. "I said. 'Col. Lindbergh is not so
          rich. Why don't you be decent to him?' " 'Well, I suppose if we can't get 70 we'll take
          50. In 10 minutes I get the note and come back.' " He told how he returned to Col.
          Lindbergh and got the box containing $50,000, Lindbergh first removing the addition*]
          $20,000 which had been brought along. He returned to the rendezvous at the hedge, be said.
          Q. What happened then? A. He was crouched down under the hedge. I said, "Come on, stand up
          like a man; I have the money." I said. "Come on, give me the note." "He put his hand In a
          coat pocket. \ Ά "I could look down on him as he vas crouching there, and I said give me
          the note.' " Gave Money to John. The witness then described how he extended the money to •
          John" on his left arm in the box. "I took the note from his left hand and he took the
          money with his right." Jafsie said he started to depart to jring the sealed note to
          Lindbergh. "Vait," John cried, Jafsie testified. "John" then took the money out of the box
          to make sure it was "all right," he explained. The witness then quoted John as saying:
          "All of them said your work was perfect." "I said. 'There is no other way to act. The
          truth should be told to a kidnaper as well as a judge.' " I said. If you're giving me a

          said 'good night,' and I said 'good night, John.' " Wilentz then again asked him. "Who is
          •John?'" ·' 'John' is Bruno Rudolf—or rather Bruno Richard Hauptmann." Condon corrected
          himself. Instructions Read. After Condon's identification of Hauptmann for the third time,
          the note instructing searchers to go to a boat was read to the jury. It was: "The boy is
          on boad Nelly it is a small boad 28 feet long two person are on the boad the are innosent.
          "You will find the boad between Horseneck Beach and Gay Head. "Near Elizabeth Island." He
          said that Col. Lindbergh and his attorney. Col. Breckinridge were present when the note
          was ready. He said the three of them started on the hunt. Q. Where did you go* A.Down to

          "Jafsie" gave the wrong middle I initial for the Nation's most cele brated aviator. He
          said that a Government boat, "a revenue cutter," was in the loca tiçn specified in the
          note. Finn Carefully Checked. A1 Reich, the ex-prizefighter who was Jafsie's aide and
          companion dur ing the ransom negotiations, went back to the witness chair as the day's
          first witness. The crowd in attendance was so great that Sheriff John H. Curtiss
          double-checked all court room passes, first at the entrance of the court house and then
          again at the court room doors. Justice Thomas W. Trenchard. who arrived with his usual
          punctuality, had difficulty making his way through the press of spectators in the aisles.
          Even Hauptmann's path was crowded as he was led in by his guards and he had to thread his
          way carefully. Pale as usual, he wore a far-away, set expression until his wife arrived
          and sat nearby him. Then his features softened as he smiled at her. Mrs Hauptmann's eyes
          looked tired and her face was deeply lined. They talked together. Chief Defense Counsel
          Reilly was a fresh-appearing, commanding figure as he strode into the court, a large white
          carnation/in his buttonhole. He conferred with his associate». C. Lloyd Fisher. Frederick
          A. Pope and Egbert Rosecrans. while Hauptmann and his wife continued their conversation.
          Attorney General Wilentz, looking crisp and jaunty, led the prosecution's staff into the
          noisy room just before court convened. Col. Lindbergh, Col. Henry Breckin- ; ridge, his
          friend and legal advisor, and Dr. Condon came in together, but not ! until several minutes
          after court had ! started. Condon had conferred with prosecu- ! tion attorneys and Col.
          Lindbergh in an ante-room for several minutes prior to his entrance. Condon followed a few
          paces behind Col. Lindbergh and Col. Breckinridge. The three sat together at the right end
          of the rail. Lindbergh wore the same gray suit he has worn every day since the be ginning
          of the trial. Dr. Condon was dressed, as yester day, in a solemn black suit, red knitted
          tie with white stripes and celluloid collar. Keich Describes Tripe. Describing the night

          taken from Haupt mann'i Bronx home and the chest of carpenter's tools found in his garage
          were in the court house for use as exhibits later in the day. The State has announced that

          Directed by Wilentz. Reich told of the preparation of the $70.000 ransom money in the box
          ordered by the kid naper. "It was there when it was packed I helped bring it up that
          afternoon from the banker'» home." he detailed, explaining the money was brought to
          Condon's in two packages, one of $50.000 and one of $20,000. "That was the afternoon of
          the night of the final pay-off." Wilentz concluded direct examina tion of Reich with a
          short series of questions regarding the ransom pay· ' ment. Q. You saw the $70,000? A.
          Yes, it was packed in a wooden box. Q. And you were present at Dr Condon's home when he
          and Col Lindbergh left to pay out the money? A. Yes. Q. How long did you wait there? j A.
          About a half hour. Q. Who was there? A. Besides myself, Mrs. Condon. Col Breckinridge, and
          Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Hacker, ι Mrs. Hacker Is Dr. Condon's daughter.) Cross-Examined.
          Wilentz then turned the witness over to Rellly for cross-examination. "Are you Dr.
          Condon's bodyguard?", Reilly began. "fio. I just go with him." The huge open-faced
          pugilist an swered questions easily. Dr. Condon, studying Reilly closely, j paid little
          heed to the witness. Q. Have you any means of Income other than a* a referee? A. I own
          some real estate. Reilly was told by the witness that Condon sometimes came to City
          Island. "That's where I live," Reich ex plained. Reich said he did not remember Dr. Condon
          coming to City Island during ransom negotiations in March. 1932. Who Suggested Payment?
          Reilly swung abruptly to the mat ter of the ransom payment. "At whose suggestion was the
          $70 000 brought to Dr. Condon's home?" "Anything that was done at the time was done with
          the consent of Col. Lindbergh, Col. Breckinridge, and Dr. Condon " "Did you hear Dr.
          Condon suggest it would be a good idea to have the monev in the Bronx." "No." "Who knew
          the money was to be in the Bronx that night?" "Col. Lindbergh. Col. Breckenridge, Dr.
          Condon and myself." "So after the money was there in the Bronx, there comes the instruc
          tion to pav the money in 30 minutes." "Yes." Reich said the police knew the pay off was to
          be made, but were not aware of at what place. Reilly pressed Rcich to explain why he did
          not follow the doctor and the flying colonel to protect them, end why he did not take a
          more important role in the proceedings. "I wasn't an executive in this: I was just a dot
          on the eye,'* the ex pugilist replied, and the court laughed heartily. y ,

          Five Jurors Opposed
          Death for Hauptmann
          Flemington, N. J., Feb. 14.— (JPh-
          The 12 Hauptmann jurors were unan
          imous on their first ballot for oon
          viction, it was learned authoritatively
          Thursday, but five were opposed, to
          the death penalty.
          In the five ballots taken, it was
          learned, two women were the first to
          switch to the death penalty. Robert
          Cravatt held out to the end.
          The jurors, information disclosed,
          . were in virtual agreement when they
          * * arrived in their deliberating room on
          the sufficiency of the evidence pre
          sented against Hauptmann. The on
          ly hesitancy among the five, who
          wanted life imprisonment, grew out
          V of the possibility of error.

          Hauptmann Gets Death Penalty;
          Prepares Appeal to High Court
          Still Has Hopes
          MRS. HAUPTMANN
          With tears rolling down her
          cheeks as her husband went si
          lently back to his cell after hear
          ing the Jury’s verdict of “guilty in
          the first degree,” Anna Haupt
          mann cried, “There is nothing
          left for me.” As she left the
          courtroom by the back door, how
          ever, she murmured, “I am not
          afraid. I still have hope.”

          Sentenced to Death
          Flemington, N. J., Feb. 14.— (JT)
          —Bruno Hauptmann, manacled
          and listening to his doom, was
          silent.
          Bruno Hauptmann went back
          to his cell in the Hunterdon coun
          ty jail, broke down and wept.
          Hearing jury and judge order
          him put to death as the killer of
          the Lindbergh baby, the Bronx
          carpenter spoke only to comfort
          his wife.
          BRUNO RICHARD HAUPTMANN
          “It’s all right. Annie," he said.
          But in the loneliness, the
          pseudo-privacy of prison which
          has been his lot for five months,
          he mumbled unintelligible Ger
          man phrases.
          Under state law, he will be held
          here at least until 11 p. m., Fri
          day. Then, 48 hours, having ex
          pired since the warrant for his
          removal was issued, he may be
          taken to the death house at Tren
          ton.
          Not until Hauptmann is taken
          to Trenton will he be permitted to
          see his wife again.
          When the foreman stuttered out
          the verdict. Hauptmann swayed
          slightly. That was his only sign
          of recognition. When the jurors
          were polled, one by one. he appar
          ently heard none of them.
          Twice he turned to nod to his
          wife.
          Then came the sentence.
          Hauptmann’s features still firm
          as steel.
          “It’s all right,” he said.

          Decision Characterized at ‘Miscarriage of Justice*; Several Claim
          $25,000 Reward for Information
          Leading to Alien** Arrest
          Flemington, N. J., Feb. 14. (AP)— Bruno Richard Haupt
          mann woke from a fitful sleep Thursday, a man condemned to
          die in the electric chair for the murder of Baby Charles A
          Lindbergh, Jr.
          Edward J. Reilly, chief of his defense counsel, character
          ized the conviction and sentence a “miscarriage of justice.” He
          and his three associates prepared to ask a stay of sentence and
          start the machinery of appeal.
          The sheriff of Hunterdon county announced he would move
          his notorious prisoner to the death house in the state prison at
          Trenton Saturday. Mrs. Anna Hauptmann continued a mourn
          ful routine of life behind drawn shades in the yellow frame
          house in which she has been staying. She was not allowed to
          visit her condemned husband.
          Mother to Ask for His Pardon
          Hauptmann’s mother in Kamenz, Germany, asked: “Is
          there no God in heaven?” and sat down to write an appeal to
          President Roosevelt—who has no veto power over a sentence
          meted out by a sovereign state.
          Reilly and his associates, confident the state will have to
          help finance an appeal, planned to plead to the public for a
          “Hauptmann defense fund” to carry on the fight.
          Shortly before noon members of the jury left the Union
          hotel for their homes under police escort.
          Several Bid for $25,000 Reward
          The several persons who figured in Hauptmann’s arrest
          awaited their rewards. Indications were thev would have to
          wait until any appeal was finally lost. The state offered
          825,000.
          The $14,000 ransom eaehe found U
          Hauptmann's garage belongs to Col*
          onel Lindbergh, who paid $50,000 ran
          som. He is not likely to get it back
          until the state is positive it will no|
          need it as evidence in a new trial.
          Prison precedent combined with'
          judge and jury to fix the night of
          March 22 as the tentative for
          Hauptmann's electrocution.
          He was sentenced to “suffer death”
          the week of March 18. and Friday is
          doomsday in the death house at Tren
          ton.
          Edward J. Reilly said an appeal
          would be carried to the United States
          supreme court if necessary.
          The first tribunal expected to hear
          the plea, the state court of errors and
          appeals, meets for its next term late
          in May. The court of pardons will
          not hear it before October.
          The Jurors who sentenced him
          showed more emotion than did
          Hauptmann as he stood before them
          at 10:45 p. m. Wednesday.
          With a look of affection, the 36-
          year-old prisoner turned to his faith
          ful wife and said:
          “It's all right, Annie.”
          Back in his cell, out of the gaze of
          the curious, Hauptmann burst into
          tears.
          The jurors required more than 11
          hours to reach their verdict. They
          were closely guarded after the case
          ended, but a courthouse report was
          that two of the women had held out
          for a recommendation of mercy. That
          would have meant a life sentence.
          There was no mention of mercy
          when the jury was polled.
          With stuttering words Foreman
          Charles Walton, Sr., announced the
          verdict. He who had listened to the
          evidence for more than six weeks
          even twisted the defendant’s name in
          his fight to remain calm.
          “Guilty,” he announced. “We finq
          the defendant, Richard Bruno Haupt
          mann, guilty of murder in the first
          degree.”
          An insignificant piece of paper
          rustled in his trembling hands. He
          glanced at the paper with unseeing
          eyes in pretense of consulting it.
          A few strides away stood Haupt
          mann, jaw set, face so pale and hag
          gard it was ghastly in the electric
          light. Sharply erect, he tottered
          slightly as he heard the foremans
          words.
          Jadga Imposes Sentence
          A few minutes later Justice Thomas
          W. Trenchard quietly imposed sen
          tence.
          0o ended the long Lindbergh kid
          nap trail. It began In Fsatharbed
          Lane, Hopewell, the night of March
          1, 1932, when the wind was bowling
          over the lonely Sourland Mountain
          on which OoL Charles A. Lindbergh
          made his home. It ended in a prosaic,
          rural courtroom Uttered with papers
          and clgaret stubs.
          Thirteen times the death dealing
          verdict was recited, on the thirteenth
          day of the month.
          After Walton had made known the
          decision, the court dark sated:
          “Members of ~w jury, you have
          heard the verdict, that you find tew
          defendant. Bruno Richard Haupt
          mann, guilty of murder in tew first
          degree, and so say you anr*
          “We do."

          BEASTS OF PREY
          The nation still has its eyes focused on the
          Lindbergh baby kidnapping .case. Altho it is
          nearly a month since the little fellow was
          stolen, all hope for the safe return of the only
          son of Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh.
          Who would have thought that the beasts
          of prey- upon society ever would become ,so
          bold as to steal the child of the gallant young
          airman who has become the modest 'idol‘ of
          the whole civilized world? '
          The fact that” these scoundrels have dar
          ed to strike at the very heart of the Lind
          bergh home constitutes a direct challenge
          to soCiety that must be answered in no uncer-
          tain terms. The abductors must be run to
          earth, no matter what the cost.
          There has been altogether too much tem
          porizinng with crooks. Many courts have
          been too lenient. And too much silly sent
          imentality has been wasted upon them. But
          this time they have gone too far. The na
          tion is arroused. .The American people will
          arise in their wrath and demand that those
          who Him by the law of the jungle shall per
          ish as jungle beasts.

          ANOTHER CLUE?
          SOUTHAMPTON, L. I., Oct-, 31,—
          Three men in an auto who were
          accosting girls, were arrested and

          Urged to Report
          On the other hand, Vogel urged
          Juneau residents to immediately re
          port to the FBI office here any
          suspicions they have of planned
          sabotage, espionage or subversive
          activity in the community.
          Vogel traced the history of the
          FBI from its start, through the re
          organization in 1924 which placed
          J. Edgar Hoover at the head of
          the bureau. He sprinkled his talk
          liberally with true crime stories
          from the records of the bureau.
          Vogel told how a cartoonist had
          spent days with Dr. John (Jafsiet
          Condon, some three months before
          the apprehension of Bruno Rich
          | aid Hauptmann for the Lindbergh
          baby kidnapping, listening to the
          description of the man in the cem
          \ etery, to whom Condon gave the
          I ransom money. Tire sketch of that
          ; man drawn by the cartoonist was
          | identical to the appearance of
          Hauptmann, when the German was
          [ later caught, Vogel said.

          SENATOR HAS THEORY
          WASHINGTON, D. C., April 25.—
          Senator Bingham of Connecticut
          said in the Senate Saturday that
          the fact that A1 Capone had twice
          offered to find the kidnapped
          Lindbergh baby if released from
          custody lends support to the belief
          "the kidnapping has been done by
          friends of Capone for this very
          purpose.”

          WARTIME HOSTAGE?
          WASHINGTON, D. C., Mar. 12.—
          President Hoover conferred Friday
          with members of his cabinet about
          the statements and desires of A1
          Capone, head of America’s golden
          age of crime, now in prison. Ca
          pone believes he can restore the
          kidnapped Lindbergh baby to its
          parents providing he is given his
          liberty.

          HOPEWELL, N. J., Mar. 12- (/P)—
          Five men are now suspected in the
          Lindbergh baby kidnapping plot
          conceived last November.
          Two of these dropped out and
          one, who abandoned the plot, was
          brought here from Tombs prison,
          New York, and the other is sought
          in an attempt to find three others
          who are believed carried the plot
          through.
          The Tombs prisoner’s name is
          closely guarded. He was brought
          after he was interviewed by Morris
          Rosner, underworld agent for Lind
          bergh.

          HOPEWELL, N. J„ Mar. 12.—The
          New Jersey police department has
          ordered a microscopic examination
          of the Sourland Hills country ad
          jacent the Lindbergh estate in the
          hope that they may uncover val
          uable clues. Sixty troopers have
          already begun the task and it is
          expected that a number more will
          be placed in the field.
          CorUliderable public resentment
          has resulted owing to the virtual
          demobilizing of the State police de
          partment to work on this one case.
          Experienced reporters believe
          Colonel Lindbergh is in communi
          cation with the kidnappers of his
          child but they declare that the kid
          nappers have not come to any def
          inite understanding with the Col
          onel as to how the child will be
          returned and how they may be
          given immunity when they return
          it
          A number of “big shot” rack
          eteers have started to “muscle in”
          on Capone’s wish to leave his pris
          on cell to locate the baby. Capone
          will be asked just what procedure
          he would follow if he were freed
          from his Cook County cell to look
          for the baby.
          All ships arriving in foreign
          ports, which left American shores
          about the time of the kidnapping,
          have been carefully searched but
          nothing has developed.

          SEARCH FOR RUM RUNNERS
          HOPEWELL, N. J. May 23. — A
          sudden and mysterious trip by Dr.
          John F. Condon to Connecticut and
          a search in Baltimore for rum run
          ntrs who are reported to have
          known of the killing of Baby Lind
          bergh before the body was discov
          ered and efforts to free John Cur
          tis from the Hunterdon county jail
          were the only developments Sat
          urday in the investigation of the
          Lindbergh baby kidnapping and
          murder.
          KIDNAPERS INTENDED
          TO ABDUCT LINDY AND
          NORFOLK, May 23, —Capt. F. H.
          Lachmann of the yacht Marcon,
          used by the Norfolk negotiators in
          an attempt to contact with the
          kidnapers of the Lindbergh baby,
          expressed the opinion that the kid
          napers intended to abduct Colonel
          Lindbergh.
          “These men asked no ransom
          before the baby’s delivery,” Lach
          mann said. “They said they would
          return the child safe and sound
          and depended on Curtis’ good faith
          to pay them on delivery so what
          could they have been aiming at if
          not to get Lindbergh?”
          He revealed especially for the
          first time that Lindbergh was on
          board during the cruises in search
          of the child and that the boat was
          heavily armed. There were stores
          of ammunition and Browning au
          tomatic rifles aboard the yacht
          each time the craft went to sea.

          INVESTIG1T0R HINDS
          OUT t FUST LINE OF THLK
          BALTIMORE, Maryland, May 23,
          (/P)—Two days before the Lind
          bergh baby was found murdered, a
          New Jersey rum runner said it had
          been murdered, according to Ar
          thur Mills, investigator, who was
          quoted in a copyrighted interview
          in the Baltimore Sun that the baby
          was kidnaped and murdered with
          no intention of saving its life.
          It was killed by blows; the actual
          murder was done by a hop head,
          Mills quoted the rum runner.
          Mills said he gave the informa
          tion to Col. H. Norman Schwartz
          kopf, of the New Jersey State po
          lice, as soon as he received it to
          gether with the name of the rum
          runner and descriptions of other
          kidnappers.

          GANGSTERS BELIEVED
          TO HAVE ‘RUBBED OUT'
          TALKATIVE BOOTLEGGER
          TRENTON, N. J. May 23. —New
          Jersey State police spent most of
          Sunday in questioning several un
          underworld characters which they
          are holding. They hope that these
          persons will make some admission
          which will give them a clue in
          their search for the slayers of the
          Lindbergh baby. The police also
          conducted a frantic search for the
          bootlegger who described the child’s
          manner of death even before the
          body was found.
          Because this person has so com
          pletely disappeared it is feared by
          police that he has been “rubbed
          out” by gangsters because he knew
          too much.
          Dr. Condon did not take any part
          in the activities but he was still be
          ing followed by two detecctaives;
          much to Condon’s annoyance.
          The church of Rev. Dodson H.
          Peacock at Norfolk was crowded to
          capacity Sunday but the Reverend
          avoided any reference to the case.

          raid. He said: “We have received
          1 word that Washington police are
          1 conducting a drive on homosex
          uals; apparently some of them
          are coming to Baltimore for their
          entertainment."

          Yesterday 139 persons ap
          peared in Baltimore's Central
          Police Court on charges of dis
          orderly conduct. Twenty-three
          others failed to appear and for
          feited $26.45 collateral each.
          The court session was a wild
          climax to a wild night. After
          several outbursts in the court
          room, Magistrate Meyer M. Car
          din threatened to add contempt
          of dourt charges to the lesser
          counts.
          Only five persons were con
          victed. All gave Baltimore ad

          Goldstein said, he sent two
          . patrolmen to check on the dub.
          “They reported back to me in
          1 about 25 minutes that the place
          ! was so crowded they could hardly!
          ■ get in; in fact, they almost had,
          to force their waybill,” Sergt
          i Goldstein said.

          “We were met by a human
          wall,” Sergt Goldstein testified.
          “The management had no con

          Judge Criticizes
          Baltimore Police
          For Mass Arrest
          BALTIMORE, Nov. 23 VP).—
          Criminal Court Judge James K.
          Cullen criticized Baltimore police
          yesterday for making a mass
          arrest of 162 persons at the
          Pepper Hill Club last October 1.
          Cullen ruleg the defendants
          Innocent of a disorderly house
          charge, saying the police action
          "negatives” their court testimony
          against the club’s licensees.
          During the trial State’s evi
          dence disclosed male patrons of
          the club were seen in acts of
          indecency.
          The judge said police had no
          right to make a mass arrest in
          the public place, pointing out
          the club was an establishment
          licensed by the State. He said
          he believed officers could have
          quietly seized upon individual
          acts of improper conduct in the
          club.
          Sergt. Hyman Goldstein, who
          led the raiding party, said the
          place was so crowded and dis
          orderly it would have been im
          possible to single out individual
          violators.

          In Inquest Into Deaths
          Of C. C. C. Men in Fire

          No Instruction
          By the Associated Pres*.
          EMPORIUM, Pa., Nov. 10.—Hop
          ing to receive a verdict by tonight
          from a Jury of six veteran woods
          men, District Attorney Edwin Tom
          kins called final witnesses today in
          the week-long inquest into the fatal
          burning of eight C. C. C. enrollees
          in a forest fire.
          Three survivors of the band of
          young fire fighters trapped last Oc
          tober 19 by flames in the rugged
          Pepper Hill section, near this
          Cameron County seat, testified yes
          terday they had never received class
          room Instruction in fire fighting
          during their enrollment in the
          Civilian Conservation Corps.
          The witnesses — Edward Sofchak
          of Glenlion, Pa.; Andrew Majorskl
          of Latrobe, Pa., and Andrew Killlany
          of Scottdale, Pa.—said they had
          fought a forest blaze the night of
          October 18, but that their only pre
          vious experience was in battling two
          grass fires. They had been enrollees
          from 13 to 22 months. Other wit
          nesses had testified the boys had
          only a few hours sleep after the
          October 18 fire before being sum
          moned to Pepper Hill.
          Peter Damico, one of the boys
          seriously burned at Pepper Hill, has
          been removed from a Renovo hos
          pital to Walter Reed Hospital in
          Washington for further treatment,

          Jury Is Recessed
          In C. C. C. Fire Deaths
          Br th« Auoclited Preis.

          coroner’s Jury of six veteran woods
          men, released from duty for the
          Armistice Day holiday, resumes to
          morrow Its deliberations to fix
          responsibility for the deaths of eight
          C. C. C. enrollees fatally burned In
          a forest fire last October 19 at
          nearby Pepper Hill.
          The Jury was dismissed late yes
          —————+
          terday until Saturday after hearing
          testimony by camp supervisors
          regarding regulations concerning

          The War Today
          An official statement on the
          fiBhting nt Verdun, issued in Pnrls
          today, says that 100,000 German
          troops participated in tho assault
          on the French positions cast of the
          Mouse yestcrdny and that 10,000 of
          these, fully one-tenth, perished in
          the attnek. Tho Germans directed
          their first blow against Pepper
          Hill, but got no further than Chaf
          four Wood, where they captured a
          few trenches, part of which the
          French have already recaptured,
          according to Paris. Chnffour
          Wood is north of Dounumont nnd
          is the key position to Pepper Hill,
          which for some' time has been "no
          man's land," being dominated by
          both the French and German ar
          tillery. Two divisions (40,000
          men) were hurled by the Crown
          Prince in Chaffour nnd Ablain
          Woods, driving southward, in an
          attempt to reach tho Douaumont
          Bras road. This attack was .stop
          ped by the terrific fire of the
          French.
          Another German division, mov
          ing from Talou Heights, moved
          southward along the west bank of
          the Mouse, but the heavy fire of
          tho enemy forced its retreat.
          Berlin claims capture of 700
          yards of trenches near Douaumont
          and some ground near Pepper Hill,
          as well ns the taking of 1700 pris
          oners. The Russian forces which were
          advancing westward along the
          Turkish coast east of Trcbizond
          have defeated, according to Pctro
          grad officinl statements, the Otto
          man troops barring their way on
          the Kara Dere River, and have
          reached the outer fortifications of
          Trcbizond, the last Turkish strong
          hold in Armenia.
          The fortress itself has already
          been attacked by Russian aviators
          and Grand Duke Nicholas' forces
          are said now to be within'll miles
          of the city.
